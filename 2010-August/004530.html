<PRE>&gt;&gt;<i> 1. Is your code based on Intel's CAN EP80579 ([1]) ?
</I>&gt;<i> No.
</I>
I want in the near future to write a Socket-CAN based driver for CAN EP80579.
As far as I've seen from your implementation there are a lot of
similarities between these
two drivers. Perhaps we can built a core part to both benefit from it.

&gt;&gt;<i> 2. Why don't you use kernel existing kfifo infrastructure? ([2]).
</I>&gt;<i> Just take a look at kfifo.h. This structure has been changed. I remembered there was a spin_lock from kfifo previously. Currently it's been removed, good.
</I>Inded, the kfifo infrastructure has suffered great reworkings in the
latest kernel versions, but this
is not an excuse to not use it.
&gt;<i> OKI-sans, would you please take a look at ./include/linux/kfifo.h, and try to use this structure and APIs?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Daniel,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We're anxious to integrate those codes now. Perhaps it'll take us quite a long time to use kfifo. How about implementing it with the next version?
</I>
In my opinion, as it looks now your code will never be accepted by the
SocketCAN maintainers.

thanks,
Daniel.
