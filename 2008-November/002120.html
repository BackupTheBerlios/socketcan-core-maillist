<PRE>Hi Kurt,

Confirmed.

Yeah, good placebo trick - see below :-)

I think your intended patch needs to look like this:

Index: af_can.c
===================================================================
--- af_can.c (Revision 870)
+++ af_can.c (working copy)
@@ -403,10 +403,10 @@
}

/* ensure valid values in can_mask */
- if (*mask &amp; CAN_EFF_FLAG)
+ if (*can_id &amp; CAN_EFF_FLAG)
*mask &amp;= (CAN_EFF_MASK | CAN_EFF_FLAG | CAN_RTR_FLAG);
else
- *mask &amp;= (CAN_SFF_MASK | CAN_RTR_FLAG);
+ *mask &amp;= (CAN_SFF_MASK | CAN_EFF_FLAG | CAN_RTR_FLAG);

/* reduce condition testing at receive time */
*can_id &amp;= *mask;



Right?

Digging into this problem, i can see that the filter API had a deeper issue:

Having can_id and mask set to zero =&gt; this is the ALL filter configuration.

The former approach sanitized the mask on the basis of the masks 
CAN_EFF_FLAG itself.

But this means, that the CAN_EFF_FLAG never get's active in the mask for 
filtering exactly for SFF frames which means:
- CAN_EFF_FLAG set in the mask
- CAN_EFF_FLAG cleared in the can_id

I made a test with the above patch with candump and a logfile i pushed 
into vcan0 with 'canplayer &lt; filtertest.log':

#1 - This is and remains the ALL filter config: can_id = mask = 0
<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/socketcan-core">hartko at vwagwolkf320</A>:~$ candump -ta vcan0,000:000

#2 - candump recognizes this to be EFF filter stuff via number length
<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/socketcan-core">hartko at vwagwolkf320</A>:~$ candump -ta vcan0,00000000:00000000

#3 - dito
<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/socketcan-core">hartko at vwagwolkf320</A>:~$ candump -ta vcan0,00000000:80000000

#4 - this is new and allows SFF can_id with EFF-flag in the filter

I think this was your addressed issue, right?

I would like to investigate if this patch has some unwanted side effects 
which i currently do not see. As you dug that deep into my code, maybe 
you can see one ;-)

Thanks very much for that feedback, Kurt!

Best regards,
Oliver

ps. I also fixed a problem in the can-utils/lib.c that can occur when 
mixed EFF and SFF frames are replayed with canplayer :-]
