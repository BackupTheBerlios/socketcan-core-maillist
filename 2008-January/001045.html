&gt;<i> Hello,
</I>
Hello Wolfgang,

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> here is a brief summary of my on-going effort to implement the new CAN
</I>&gt;<i> device interface and the reference driver for the SJA1000. So far, I
</I>&gt;<i> have applied the following improvements and new features to the
</I>&gt;<i> Socket-CAN branch &quot;cannetdriver26&quot;:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
[...]

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> o Bitrate setting
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>   There are the following rules:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>   - The bitrate can *not* be modified when the device is active.
</I>&gt;<i>     &quot;ifconfig down&quot; must be called first.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>   - Currently we have the following macro definitions for bitrates:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     #define CAN_BITRATE_UNCONFIGURED	((__u32) 0xFFFFFFFFU)
</I>&gt;<i>     #define CAN_BITRATE_UNKNOWN		0
</I>&gt;<i>     #define CAN_BITRATE_DEFAULT		500000
</I>
What's the difference between UNCONFIGURED and UNKNOWN ?

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>   - A default bitrate is used and set in common code when the driver
</I>&gt;<i> is registered. It is currently defined by CAN_BITRATE_DEFAULT in
</I>&gt;<i>     ioctl.h 
</I>
Should probably have a different name now that we don't have ioctls.

&gt;<i> but we may want to have an additional module paramter of
</I>&gt;<i>     can-dev.ko for overwrite it. Comments?
</I>
I find it enough (and even better) if we agree that the default bitrate
is always 500000. An application will set it to its desired value
anyway.

&gt;<i>     Note that the device driver can define and set its own, non
</I>&gt;<i>     standard bitrate and timing. For this purpose I have implemented a
</I>&gt;<i>     common can_set_bitrate() function.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>   As you know, we want to have a re-vised bit-time setting, which we
</I>&gt;<i>   should discuss sooner than later.
</I>
Sooner, please. That crazy bitrate arithmetics is often the most time
consuming task when writing a driver, as you cannot simply copy it
from another driver. So we should agree upon some standard that every
driver must fulfill, otherwise we'll have different opinions about time
settings with each new driver. And we'll have user applications that
work fine with one driver, but not with another.

[...]

&gt;<i> What do you think? Comments, improvements, new CAN device
</I>&gt;<i> drivers and patches are welcome.
</I>
Wolfgang, many thanks to you for this excellent work! You've managed to
put together all the results of the various discussions, and generate
an API that is complete and clean, AFAICT.
Great! I'll print out your mail and keep it as a reference...

Thanks,
Hans
