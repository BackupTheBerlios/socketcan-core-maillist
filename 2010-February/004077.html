Sounds good and from my point of view the driver is more or less ready
for mainline inclusion. If that is your primary goal and you feel it is
mature and stable enough, please send a proper patch series as described
here:

<A HREF="http://svn.berlios.de/svnroot/repos/socketcan/trunk/README.submitting-patches.">http://svn.berlios.de/svnroot/repos/socketcan/trunk/README.submitting-patches.</A>

As an alternative, I could apply it to the SVN trunk for the time being.
There, the requirements for acceptance are not that high.

I briefly browsed the patches. Here some quick comments:

- I do still not find __devinit, __devexit, and friends in your drivers
  as described here:

  <A HREF="http://lxr.linux.no/#linux+v2.6.32/Documentation/PCI/pci.txt#L177">http://lxr.linux.no/#linux+v2.6.32/Documentation/PCI/pci.txt#L177</A>

  They are also missing in janz-ican3.c.

- You may need to declare some structures &quot;__attribute__((packed))&quot;,

- Don't include sja1000/sja1000.h. It's only for drivers in sja1000.
  I know that some other drivers use SJA1000 definitions as well, but
  that requires a general solution.

- Some time ago we agreed to use &quot;_&quot; for the Socket-CAN file names:
  s/janz-ican3/janz_ican3/

- You still use many hard-code numbers in the code. Please define
  values for most of them to make the code more readable.

- There are still to much dev_dbg(). They should especially not be used
  in the xmit and recv path.

- I see still a lot of duplicated code, especially for desc handling.
  Maybe some helper functions or combined i/o functions for send/recv
  could make the code more compact.

- Checkpatch reports &quot;lines too long&quot;.

- s+&lt;linux/janz.h&gt;+&lt;linux/mfd/janz.h&gt;+ ?

- Check MODULE_LICENSE(). It does not match with your copyright notes.

- About xmit flow control. What happens if you send messages quickly at
  125 KB/s. You could use &quot;cangen -g 0 can0&quot; for that test. How many
  messages get dropped?

Wolfgang.
