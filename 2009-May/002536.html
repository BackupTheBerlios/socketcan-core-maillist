I will try that first.

</I>
We support old kernels and socket-can version anyhow and therefore it's
not much more effort to maintain backward compatibility with SYSFS as
well.
 
&gt;<i> Do you know how far in kernel history the netlink interface works?
</I>
Currently I use:

#if LINUX_VERSION_CODE &lt; KERNEL_VERSION(2,6,24) || defined(CONFIG_CAN_DEV_SYSFS)
#define USE_CAN_DEV_SYSFS
#endif

from vcan.c, but I have to check more carefully.

&gt;<i> If it's since e.g. 2.6.18, i would suggest to make a cut there and only

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> And if someone needs &lt;2.6.18 he could use the tagged sysfs version.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Any opinions?
</I>
See above.

Wolfgang.
