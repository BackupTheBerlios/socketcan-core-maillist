Yes, i also see this to become a problem.

The canhwid is something unique like the /sys/class/net/eth0/address for
ethernet devices. So IMO it needs to be in /sys/class/net/can0/canhwid ...

As the 'address' and the 'addr_len' both can be set be the driver we would
also be able to use this pair of already defined sysfs entries - but i assume,
we will be punished for that suggestion ;-)

Remembering Wolfgangs point to have separate entries for
vendor/serialnumber/etc is something i have a problem with:

A canhwid is something unique that can only be built by the driver, as *only*
the driver knows, how to build a unique string out of it's configuration
(regarding serial numbers, ioports, whatever).

Providing vendor names and product information in a string format in the sysfs
is _not_ usual. And 'scanning' for CAN specific values in sysfs to find
something unique will lead to a udev scripting hell.

Maybe after all this discussion and after coming back to sysfs the idea behind
a driver generated unique canhwid has become clearer.

IMO we could define a common specification, how the canhwid has to be built by
the driver, e.g.

&lt;drvname&gt;#&lt;vendor&gt;#&lt;product&gt;#&lt;serialnumber&gt;#&lt;ioport&gt;#&lt;channel&gt;#

cpc-pcmcia#EMS Wuensche#CPC-Card#12345678#0x1000#0#
sja1000-isa###0x320##

Just an idea, which could be easily handled by udev.

For the &quot;+5V on Pin1&quot; use-case i would tend to a vendor specific

/sys/class/net/can0/enable_5v_on_pin1

or something like this.

Regards,
Oliver
