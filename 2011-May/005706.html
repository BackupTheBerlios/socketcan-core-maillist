Yes, 11 or 29 bits, to be correct.

&gt;<i> What are these IDs for? Do they identify a local port, a remote address,
</I>&gt;<i> a connection, or something else?
</I>
It's a message identifier, which is used for bus arbitration and which
other CAN nodes can listen to. See also:

<A HREF="http://lxr.linux.no/#linux+v2.6.38/Documentation/networking/can.txt#L146">http://lxr.linux.no/#linux+v2.6.38/Documentation/networking/can.txt#L146</A>

&gt;&gt;<i> There is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> no other CAN controller with such rather serious limitations and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> therefore there exists also no appropriate interface. I think using
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> sysfs is OK for such device-specific parameters, at least for the time
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> being.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It sounds like it's not very scalable, especially since the implementation
</I>&gt;<i> is done completely in firmware. Imagine a new firmware version suddenly
</I>&gt;<i> supporting 256 ids instead of 8 -- you'd then have to create 256 sysfs
</I>&gt;<i> files to be compatible if I understand you correctly.
</I>
Well, than an array of CAN identifiers per file would indeed be more
appropriate.

&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> How hard would it be to implement that feature in Socket CAN?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> CAN controllers usually provide some kind of hardware CAN id filtering,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> but in a very hardware dependent way. A generic interface may be able to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> handle the PRUSS restrictions as well. CAN devices are usually
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> configured through the netlink interface. e.g.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   $ ip link set can0 up type can bitrate 125000
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and such a common interface would be netlink based as well.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Agreed.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Is that something that Subhasish or someone else could to as a prerequisite
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> to merging the driver?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Any ideas on how to handle hardware filtering in a generic way are
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> welcome. I will try to come up with a proposal sooner than later.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It sounds to me like the best solution would be change the firmware
</I>&gt;<i> to lift that restriction and simply allow all IDs, in case it's not
</I>&gt;<i> actually a hardware limitation (which sounds unlikely).
</I>
Yes, that would be best but they told us, that it's not possible with
the available hardware resources. Subhasish?

&gt;<i> If that's not possible, maybe it's possible to define a generic
</I>&gt;<i> filtering interface using netlink, and then either do it completely
</I>&gt;<i> in the kernel, or using the hardware support.
</I>
Well, I hesitate to implement an interface especially for such an exotic
device. Fine if it could be handled by a generic CAN hardware filter
interface, which is especially useful for normal CAN controllers.

Wolfgang.
