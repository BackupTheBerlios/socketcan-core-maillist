<PRE>Hello,

I'm currently testing a MCP2515 connected to an AT91-board.

Besides some small changes to use an gpio-irq, I've come across about a 
problem in the driver which leads to an endless IRQ. For the test I've 
used two nodes, a PEAK USB controller and said MCP2515, both configured 
to use a bitrate of 500k. When I'm now sending a simple message from the 
peak, the mcp251x-driver will end in an endless irq and the MCP2515 will 
endless send error-messages.

Here is an debug output which should describe the problem:

---------------------------------------------
peak:
cansend can0 &quot;5A1#11.2233.44556677.01 / 123#DEADBEEF / 5AA# /&quot;

at91:
[   93.730000] mcp251x_can_ist entered
[   93.770000] mcp251x_can_ist intf: 0xa0
[   93.890000] mcp251x_can_ist eflag: 0xb
  forever:
[   93.930000] mcp251x_can_ist intf: 0x80
[   94.060000] mcp251x_can_ist eflag: 0xb
[   94.100000] mcp251x_can_ist intf: 0x80
[   94.220000] mcp251x_can_ist eflag: 0xb
...

peak:
candump any,0:0,#ffffffff
  forever:
   can0  20000004  [8] 00 04 00 00 00 00 00 00   ERRORFRAME
---------------------------------------------

Using the at91_can-driver (and can-hw) instead of the mcp251x on the 
AT91 box I can't reproduce this, so it seems not to be a problem of the 
cabling or the sender (peak) side.

Anyway, currently I don't care for the reason of the fault on the bus, 
but I think at least that endless loop is something which should be 
adressed because this renders the AT91 system almost useless (and could 
be triggered from remote).

My first simple solution for this is currently the following patch:

--------------------------------
diff --git a/drivers/net/can/mcp251x.c b/drivers/net/can/mcp251x.c
index b11a0cb..e1a3745 100644
--- a/drivers/net/can/mcp251x.c
+++ b/drivers/net/can/mcp251x.c
@@ -835,7 +835,7 @@ static irqreturn_t mcp251x_can_ist(int irq, void 
*dev_id)
                         }
                 }

-               if (intf == 0)
+               if ((intf &amp; ~CANINTF_MERRF) == 0)
                         break;

                 if (intf &amp; (CANINTF_TX2IF | CANINTF_TX1IF | 
CANINTF_TX0IF)) {
--------------------------------

With that patch the IRQ will be released even if the MERRF is set in the 
CANINTF-register. This will not fix the problem, but at least the system 
is still usable in such a case.

I'm no CAN expert, but I think a correct solution would be to restart 
the MCP2515 after a MERRF was received and didn't go away (restart-ms).

The datasheet for the MCP2515 doesn't talk much about MERRF while 
receiving (just a sentence in section 7.4 Message Error Interrupt), and 
the chart for message reception shows why the Error Frames are generated 
endless.

Any pointers/suggestions?

Regards,

Alexander
