It's about the second one, the bus-error interrupts, which may make
trouble. On low end systems, they may hang the system if they are
handled in the interrupt context but also in a threaded interrupt
handler, I assume. They do not harm that much if NAPI is used instead.
The SJA1000 has the most sophisticated bus error reporting. Have a look
to the data sheet or the sja1000/sja1000.c for further information.
