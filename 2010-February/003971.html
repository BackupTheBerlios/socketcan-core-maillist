Which controller are we speaking of? I have some experience with the
mcp251x. On this there are 2 kinds of interrupts: one that informs
just about the transition of CAN error (error-active, error-warning,
error-passive and bus-off) states and another that informs of every
single error in message tx/rx. The first one is absolutely easy to
handle, but the second one is an overkill in error-passive state (for
example if someone just opens the bus while is a transmission pending
which is automatically retried), especially now that the interrupt
thread was moved to a threaded interrupt (and so it has a RT priority
meaning it gives little chance to run to user-space space SCHED_OTHER
processes to act upon the error state). I think we should try to make
to most of internal accounting of errors which is required from CAN
controller by somehow exporting TEC and REC counters.
