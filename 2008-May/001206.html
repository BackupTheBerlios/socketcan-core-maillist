This is no real issue. Search the MAINTAINERs file for 'NETWORK' and 
you'll see, that there are maintainers for single network drivers as 
well as for complete network layers. E.g.

grep -A2 AX.25 MAINTAINERS

So it is not even usual to tunnel all the stuff via one single person. 
When there is much upstream traffic it makes sense to cluster things - 
like Jeff Garzik does for the net drivers. But this is a floating 
process and i can't see why we should expose a single person for all the 
CAN stuff.

Finally i agree with you, that we're not that far with the drivers right 
now.

&gt;<i> I already ask Wolfgang (Denk) and hosting the Socket-CAN-GIT-Repository

</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>
This could be very interesting to get some practice with git. Especially 
for you ;-)

Best regards,
Oliver
