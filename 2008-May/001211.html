Seconded. And with git, the gatekeeper role is even easier these days,
at least for a project of the size of SocketCAN.

Nevertheless, if the maintainer has pulled patches into his tree, it's
his responsibility to keep it in sync with his upstream, and that's
something which has to be done regularly and needs time.

&gt;<i> &gt; My main concern is transparency. If a developer starts work, he

</I>
Yes, but I think Hans-J&#252;rgen is right here that it is important to have
a clear hierarchy of trees. Otherwhise we get the same chaos as with
ARM, where nobody knows any more which tree to work against (it is clear
now, but wasn't in the past).
