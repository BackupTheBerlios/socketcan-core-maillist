<PRE>Hi Oliver,
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There are two assumptions in the patch that do not fit to the idea of a line
</I>&gt;<i> discipline and i was looking around in the internet and some code in the
</I>&gt;<i> Kernel that implements line disciplines.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You current approach implements some kind of flow control inside the ldisc as
</I>&gt;<i> you expect the incoming characters \r or \a are some kind of acknowledges for
</I>&gt;<i> the sent frames.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Indeed \r and \a are just skipped in the input stream.
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>Hmm, flow control works a little bit different:
The first byte the driver receives indicates whats coming after:
't' for a normal CAN frame
'T' for an extended CAN frame
0xe0 for a response.
After receiving the first byte the respective flag in sl is set.
In case that the first byte indicated a message, normal buffering and
decapsulation
is done, but if the first byte was 0xe0 the next byte is the return
value of a message
transmission. After receiving that byte, the buffer is reset and
everything starts again.
Think of it like another kind of message, like 'R'/'r'.
&gt;<i> The other thing is that you should better add a flag to sl-&gt;flags for the
</I>&gt;<i> binary encapsulation instead of creating a boolean value.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>Ah, thats what's slcan_magic is used for... I'll add the flag(s).
&gt;<i> Please try to work with the tty as there were completely independent
</I>&gt;<i> i/o-streams to be processed by the ldisc and look into other implementations,
</I>&gt;<i> e.g.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://lxr.linux.no/#linux+v2.6.30.5/drivers/net/irda/irtty-sir.c#L87">http://lxr.linux.no/#linux+v2.6.30.5/drivers/net/irda/irtty-sir.c#L87</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> how the throttling of outgoing data is managed.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Maybe you should spend a hardware 'CTS' line for that or reduce the serial
</I>&gt;<i> bitrate so that your Atmel typically can cope with the data.
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>Hmm, the problem of hardware flow control is: Most USB&lt;-&gt;RS232
converters only support RXD, TXD and GND.
That's why I tend not to use them. Currently, at 38400 Baud, the Atmel
has no problem with the data rate. I think
even at 115200 Baud(the maximum supported baud rate of most PC adapters)
it shouldn't be a problem in normal
situations. But under heavy bus load, well, just in case...
&gt;<i> I don't have a good feeling creating a flow control mechanism (that's not even
</I>&gt;<i> ensured by e.g. some kind of sequence counter or whatever) inside the ldisc.
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>Why do we need sequence counters?
&gt;<i> FWICS the ldisc generally knows about [en|de]capsualtion but let's the tty do
</I>&gt;<i> it's job to push the information to the device.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There is currently no concept how to recover the data stream with a special
</I>&gt;<i> token - which was pretty easy with the ASCII stuff. Maybe all the binary
</I>&gt;<i> information needs to be packed into bytes with bit 7 set and the binary values
</I>&gt;<i>  need to be split up into 7 bit chunks that are placed below bit 7, e.g.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>That would greatly impact the performance...
Recovery should be possible if the driver looks on more than one byte if
it has lost sync, I could try that.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm sorry coming with a new idea now, but IMO the robustness of the protocol
</I>&gt;<i> is the basis for a reliable driver ...
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>No Problem ;)

Regards,

Maximilian
