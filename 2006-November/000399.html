<PRE>Sorry for my late reply.

Yes, that's a nice idea.  First, I had some doubts if this looks clean
from the API side.  But that was because I had a wrong view on it.
Oliver implemented your request and that taught me the right view.  I
now find this quite beautiful.

My first thought was, that after opening you have *no* filter list set
and therefore get the default behavior which is to receive all frames.
You can then set a number of filters to control what to receive.
Setting the filter list to 0 filters would restore the default
behavior of receiving everything (this was not implemented, however).
In fact, with the previous implementation you could achieve what you
want, i.e. receiving nothing, by setting a one-element filter list
containing a filter that would never match, e.g. mask 1, value 2 (I
admit, this is not very beautiful).

Now, I look at things differently.  There is not a default behavior
for the case that there is no filter list.  You *always* have a filter
list in the socket.  The default after opening is a list containg
exactly one element matching all CAN frames.  You can then set any
filter list of any length.  A list of length zero would mean no
filter, i.e. no CAN frames are received. There is no &quot;unset&quot; socket
option to restore the default you get after opening the socket, and
IMHO it's not needed. This can be done by explicitly setting a
one-element filter list with mask = 0, i.e. a filter that receives
everything.

Thank you for your question pointing out that idea and thanks to
Oliver for the implementation giving me the right understanding.
