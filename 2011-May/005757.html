In 'real world' CAN setups you'll never see 21.000 CAN frames per second (and
therefore 21.000 irqs/s) - you are usually designing CAN network traffic with
less than 60% busload. So interrupt rates somewhere below 1000 irqs/s can be
assumed.

&gt;<i>From what i've seen so far a 3-4 messages rx FIFO and NAPI support just make it.
</I>
@Marc/Wolfgang: Would this be also your recommendation for a CAN controller
design that supports SocketCAN in the best way?

As the Linux network stack supports hardware timestamps too, this could be an
additional (optional!) feature.
