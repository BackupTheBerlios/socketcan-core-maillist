</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Hello all,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I posted last week asking about a driver for boards running on a PLX
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; chip. It turns out that these are passive boards. I have been looking
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; for a driver for the Janz CMOD-IO board CAN interfaces.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I finally found the datasheets and took the time to write a driver. This
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; board is an intelligent CAN interface: it has onboard microprocessors to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; help process CAN traffic.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; This is a very rough first try at a CAN driver. I'm sure it still has
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; problems, and I would appreciate if you can take a look and help me add
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; what is needed. I'm am not extremely knowledgeable about the CAN bus.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The things that are known to be wrong:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; - bus-on / bus-off handling
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I did this straight in the network device open()/stop() methods. I don't
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; handle the condition where we get too many bus errors and the bus goes
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; into bus-off state. What should I be doing here?
</I>&gt;<i> What you call 'bus-off' is indeed the stop() method. the CAN busoff
</I>&gt;<i> (which is something different)
</I>&gt;<i> comes via interrupt (bus-state-change), indicating the
</I>&gt;<i> can-chip cut itself from the bus. In such case, a special 'struct
</I>&gt;<i> can_frame' must be emitted to userspace.
</I>
Ok. The way I read this: the netdevice open()/stop() methods should put
the device into &quot;CAN buson&quot; and &quot;CAN busoff&quot; state. In addition, when
the device has an error, it will go into &quot;CAN busoff&quot; state eventually.
In this case, I should generate a special CAN frame and send it to
userspace. Is that right?

&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; - state changes, bit timing, etc.
</I>&gt;<i> the bittiming looks exactly as SJA1000 (especially the resulting
</I>&gt;<i>       register values). please take a look there.
</I>
This isn't too surprising: the module uses an SJA1000 chip for the
actual CAN communications.

&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I'm not at all sure how this is supposed to work. Perhaps someone that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; knows CAN bus better that I do can help.
</I>&gt;<i> The bittiming is calculated (in drivers/net/can/dev.c) from the
</I>&gt;<i> constants you provide. again, sja1000 is a 'reference'.
</I>&gt;<i> opening/closing:
</I>&gt;<i> from userspace, the open() gets called somehow. You will activate the
</I>&gt;<i> can chip (what you called 'bus-on', which is a strange terminology IMHO).
</I>&gt;<i> can messages come &amp; go now. When there are distortions on the CAN bus,
</I>&gt;<i>     the CAN chip will raise some errors (via interrupts). At a certain
</I>&gt;<i>     point, distortions get so bad and the can chip cuts itself from the
</I>&gt;<i>     bus (accompanied by an interrupt, as mentioned above).
</I>&gt;<i>     You are not supposed to call close() there.
</I>
Ok. By &quot;bus-on&quot; and &quot;bus-off&quot;, I was referring to &quot;CAN bus-on&quot; and &quot;CAN
bus-off&quot;. I'm well aware of how a Linux network device works. :)

So the controller may go &quot;CAN busoff&quot; due to errors, but not stop the
network device. This makes sense. In this case I generate an error
frame.

&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; - CAN bus termination
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; This board supports optionally terminating the CAN bus. In order to test
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; this driver, I connected both CAN modules on a single board together. To
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; get this to work, I needed to turn on termination on both modules.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Is this wrong?
</I>&gt;<i> A bus must have both ends terminated (although a labo setup will do with
</I>&gt;<i>       1 termination too). The idea is that not every 'node' in the
</I>&gt;<i> middle must terminate the bus, only the endpoints.
</I>&gt;<i> What you did seems right.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Is there a way to enable/disable termination via the &quot;ip&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; tool?
</I>&gt;<i> There is at this point no such thing yet. Such properties may be enabled
</I>&gt;<i> via sysfs IMHO.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; - module probing
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; This board is really a MODULbus carrier board, into which plugs 4
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; daughterboards. These can be CAN modules, or others. On my board, I have
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 2x CAN modules and 1x TTL GPIO module. I need support for both of these
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; for my application. For the time being, I *did not* add support for the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; TTL module. That will come once the CAN part is finished.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Also, there is no way I am aware of to determine what type of board is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; plugged into which MODULbus slot on the carrier board. My CAN modules
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; support identification, but the TTL module does not.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I hard-coded the module layout into the driver itself. This is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; sufficient for my purposes, but probably is not sufficient for mainline
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Linux :'(. Any ideas or suggestions?
</I>&gt;<i> I would (but I'm not authoring this) construct a PCI driver for the
</I>&gt;<i> carrier board, with 4 platform devices. During probe of the PCI drivers,
</I>&gt;<i> you can tweak the ID's of the platform devices.
</I>&gt;<i> Next, you create seperate drivers: CAN, TTL, ....
</I>&gt;<i> in drivers/mfd, you'll find some examples of what I try to explain.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> You will have to provide some access methods for the platform_devices.
</I>&gt;<i> That's where you will link daughterboards to carrier board.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> And to make life simpler, you can create bigger structs for the
</I>&gt;<i> platform_device, as in:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> struct janz_device {
</I>&gt;<i>    struct platform_device pdev;
</I>&gt;<i>    struct pci_device *carrier;
</I>&gt;<i>    int (*reg_rd)(struct janz_device *, etc ...);
</I>&gt;<i>    void (*reg_wr)(struct janz_device *, etc ...);
</I>&gt;<i>    ....
</I>&gt;<i> };
</I>&gt;<i> #defien platform_to_janz(x) container_of(x, struct janz_device, pdev)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> As such, a clean seperation can be made between the carrier board &amp; the
</I>&gt;<i> differen daughter boards.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
That sounds great. I'll try and follow the drivers/mfd example you
mention.

&gt;<i> &gt; Any review will be much appreciated!
</I>&gt;<i> Did not get there in detail :-)
</I>
Thanks for what you have done! I'll have another version soon, with your
comments addressed.

Ira
