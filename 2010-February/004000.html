&gt;<i> Hello all,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I posted last week asking about a driver for boards running on a PLX
</I>&gt;<i> chip. It turns out that these are passive boards. I have been looking
</I>&gt;<i> for a driver for the Janz CMOD-IO board CAN interfaces.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I finally found the datasheets and took the time to write a driver. This
</I>&gt;<i> board is an intelligent CAN interface: it has onboard microprocessors to
</I>&gt;<i> help process CAN traffic.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This is a very rough first try at a CAN driver. I'm sure it still has
</I>&gt;<i> problems, and I would appreciate if you can take a look and help me add
</I>&gt;<i> what is needed. I'm am not extremely knowledgeable about the CAN bus.
</I>
You are welcome. I think the esd_pci331 drive should answer most of your
 questions.

&gt;<i> The things that are known to be wrong:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> - bus-on / bus-off handling
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I did this straight in the network device open()/stop() methods. I don't
</I>&gt;<i> handle the condition where we get too many bus errors and the bus goes
</I>&gt;<i> into bus-off state. What should I be doing here?
</I>
Search for &quot;can_bus_off&quot; in esd_pci331.c. The controller (hardware) goes
bus-off if to much errors occurred and it's necessary to handle that
event in the driver and report it to the apps. Yon can only recover from
 a bus-off initiating a so called bus-off recovery, which is done via
esd331_set_mode(CAN_MODE_START).

&gt;<i> - state changes, bit timing, etc.
</I>
Search for &quot;alloc_can_err_skb&quot; and &quot;CAN_ERR&quot; in esd_pci331.c. We report
CAN error state changes and errors via so called CAN error messages,
which the apps can receive on request.

&gt;<i> I'm not at all sure how this is supposed to work. Perhaps someone that
</I>&gt;<i> knows CAN bus better that I do can help.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> - CAN bus termination
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This board supports optionally terminating the CAN bus. In order to test
</I>&gt;<i> this driver, I connected both CAN modules on a single board together. To
</I>&gt;<i> get this to work, I needed to turn on termination on both modules.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Is this wrong? Is there a way to enable/disable termination via the &quot;ip&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> tool?
</I>
No, that's specific to this driver and could be implemented via SysFS,
as Kurt suggested.

&gt;<i> - module probing
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This board is really a MODULbus carrier board, into which plugs 4
</I>&gt;<i> daughterboards. These can be CAN modules, or others. On my board, I have
</I>&gt;<i> 2x CAN modules and 1x TTL GPIO module. I need support for both of these
</I>&gt;<i> for my application. For the time being, I *did not* add support for the
</I>&gt;<i> TTL module. That will come once the CAN part is finished.
</I>
The modules are connected to the PCI bus, I assume. The TTL module
should be handled by a dedicated driver.

&gt;<i> Also, there is no way I am aware of to determine what type of board is
</I>&gt;<i> plugged into which MODULbus slot on the carrier board. My CAN modules
</I>&gt;<i> support identification, but the TTL module does not.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I hard-coded the module layout into the driver itself. This is
</I>&gt;<i> sufficient for my purposes, but probably is not sufficient for mainline
</I>&gt;<i> Linux :'(. Any ideas or suggestions?
</I>
This information could be provide via module parameter, for example.

&gt;<i> Any review will be much appreciated!
</I>
Puh, that's a lot of untested code. Some general comments/questions:

- You use NAPI and a work-queue. Why do you need both?

- I do not see how you control the flow of TX messages? To be more
  precise, I do not find netif_stop_queue() in your xmit path.

- You can use the standard bit-timing calculation. See how it's done in
  sja1000/sja1000.c. Search for sja1000_bittiming_const and
  sja1000_set_bittiming.

- You do not handle echo skb's. Search for can_get_echo_skb() and
  can_put_echo_skb() for local loopback.

As I see it, this code does not run or even compile yet... too early for
a full review.

Wolfgang.
