</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - I would follow more closely the existing PHY implementation.
</I>&gt;<i> I know PHY looks similar. Oliver suggested that also.
</I>&gt;<i> First trouble: I'm not very familiar with those.
</I>&gt;<i> So, I did look at them. My conclusion is that it is not very suitable
</I>&gt;<i> for anything other than ethernet. Since we're now evaluating these, I'll
</I>&gt;<i> summarize my findings.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> * The way PHY is implemented right now is a rather solid unit of both
</I>&gt;<i> access methods &amp; functional methods. My interpretation is this:
</I>&gt;<i> a PHY is indicated by an address of some MDIO bus (access method).
</I>&gt;<i> It provides then a set of registers (access method).
</I>&gt;<i> These registers can be layed out as the MII interface (functional
</I>&gt;<i>       method).  As such, a 'generic' PHY is implemented.
</I>&gt;<i> CAN transceivers today have no common access method. Therefore, only the
</I>&gt;<i> functional part of PHY can be used. And the functional part of PHY is
</I>&gt;<i> very ethernet oriented.
</I>&gt;<i> The result (my proposal) is rather similar in the functional part. But
</I>&gt;<i> by instantiating a new class, which provides no access methods at all,
</I>&gt;<i> the overhead per transceiver is lowered.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Another major drawback from reusing PHY is that besides the rather
</I>&gt;<i> heavy modifications, ethernet should still keep on working.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> * The clean seperation between datalink &amp; physical layer that exists on
</I>&gt;<i> etherenet is not respected on CAN. An ethernet controller seems to rely
</I>&gt;<i> completely on it's PHY to decide the carrier is off. CAN chips on the
</I>&gt;<i> other side do this theirselve (for increased predictability) by going
</I>&gt;<i> busooff. So, you'd end up with 2 sources deciding things about
</I>&gt;<i> the carrier. This would require some other cooperation model
</I>&gt;<i> than what exists for PHY right now.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Also, the PHY's statemachine for autonegotiation is something that would
</I>&gt;<i> on CAN typically be performed purely by or at least with cooperation of
</I>&gt;<i> the CAN chip. I don't know any transceiver today that could do this on
</I>&gt;<i> its own, as happens on ethernet.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> * 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> summarized, I believe the differences are way bigger than the
</I>&gt;<i> similarities.
</I>
I did not say (or mean) that you should use the PHY interface for CAN
transceiver. I would just follow more closely the PHY framework, like
registering drivers, etc.

&gt;&gt;<i> - SysFS is not an option.
</I>&gt;<i> I must admit I do not totally understand this argument during the
</I>&gt;<i> bittiming development of yours either.
</I>&gt;<i> please note that my transceiver implementation is 'rather' seperated
</I>&gt;<i> from the net_devices.
</I>&gt;<i> On the other hand, if transceiver control could be implemented via
</I>&gt;<i> netlink too, I would not veto that.
</I>
The netdev people told use to use the netlink interface for the CAN
device configuration and therefore it's unlikely that they will accept a
SysFS interface for the CAN transceivers. But we could try, in principle.

&gt;&gt;<i> - It's a lot of code for the functionality it provides (that's just my
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   first impression).
</I>&gt;<i> That's a difficult argument :-).
</I>
I know. It's mainly &quot;bla, bla&quot; for the time being.

&gt;&gt;<i> When time permits, I will have a closer look. Hopefully before Oliver is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> back from holiday. This new interface will require some time to mature.
</I>&gt;<i> sure.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> If you need a quick solution, resend your original patch for the SJA1000
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> similar to the one of the AT91. It should also not be a big deal to push
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> it upstream.
</I>&gt;<i> I'd avoid an implementation that integrates one single predefined
</I>&gt;<i> transceiver (pca82c251) into every driver. That's the bad way.
</I>&gt;<i> My SJA1000 patch learned me that I was sure not the only one looking for
</I>&gt;<i> that kind of functionality.
</I>
That's what we currently need. There are no real use-cases for the
extended functionality and therefore there is no hurry to get it in.
I do not see any problem to replace the controller specific interface
with a more generic one later-on.

&gt;<i> Oliver's contribution is that there's a lot more functionality than just
</I>&gt;<i> enable the transceiver.
</I>
Yes, but till now nobody needs it or at least asked for it, IIRC. Please
speak up if I have missed something.

&gt;<i> For my system, I still can do with my previous patch, or use my
</I>&gt;<i> transciever drivers from now. The advantage of the latter is that it is
</I>&gt;<i> quite seperated from CAN chip drivers, and gives SYSFS access on how the
</I>&gt;<i> system connected.
</I>
I understand your arguments but I think we need more time to first
understand the requirements and how to implement it thereafter
efficiently. I really appreciate your effort to start working on this topic.

Quick question: why do we need a SysFS/Netlink interface at all?

Wolfgang.
