Not really. Currently we are discussing the issue and I hope that we can 
find an acceptable solution soon.

You are too fast ;-).

&gt;<i> I like some interface like that. I am not trying to get rid of the sysfs interface, but when bittiming

</I>
The IOCTL interface is deprecated and there is no chance to get that 
mainline. It was removed for that reason some time ago.

&gt;<i> 4/4: while getting in the source code, I found a function pointer for changing MTU.
</I>&gt;<i> I did not have issues yet, but cancelling here seemed like a good idea.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I started using quilt in order to create cleaner patches. applying must be done with -p1 !
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> These patches are probably not production ready, as the bittiming is still evolving. It's more a try
</I>&gt;<i> to help simplifying the job. Just let me know if it gets usefull.
</I>
We first must decide how to set the bit-timing. Little of the current 
implementation will survive.

Wolfgang.
