ACK - this morning i changed can0 and can1 and got the same problem.

</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>AFAIK can0 and can1 share the same interrupt (wired-or).
I assume the problem to be like this:

1. e.g. can1 get's an irq and pulls the line
2. irq handler is invoked
3. irq handler checks can0 (nothing found)
4. then (critical!) can0 get's an irq and pulls the line
5. irq handler checks can1 and handles it's irq

=&gt; irq handler is done but the line is still pulled by can0 =&gt; end of 
traffic

My original fix was to handle both controllers as long as there's 
nothing to handle on both controllers.

But i don't have a nice idea how this can be archived in the current driver.

Some time ago i implemented a twinepp driver that had a similar problem 
with two SJA1000 connected to *one* EPP-port.
The solution was to clear the interrupt (of the EPP - see &quot;tmp=inb(pb)&quot;) 
after processing the second twin controller:

/* hardware specific work to do at end of irq handler */
void hw_postirq(struct net_device *dev)
{
    struct can_priv *priv = netdev_priv(dev);
    struct net_device *tdev = priv-&gt;twin;
    unsigned long base = dev-&gt;base_addr;
    unsigned long pb = base + 1;

    volatile u8 tmp;

    /* do NOT perform for first interrupt: wait for the twin */

    BUG_ON(!tdev);

    if (!(dev-&gt;flags &amp; IFF_UP) || !(tdev-&gt;flags &amp; IFF_UP) ||
        (tdev-&gt;dev_id)) {
        tdev-&gt;dev_id = 0;
        dev-&gt;dev_id = 0;
        tmp = inb(pb);
    } else
        dev-&gt;dev_id = 1;

    tmp++;
}

But all this was sooo ugly and also had impacts on the sja1000.c that i 
never wanted to post it ...

Did you get any idea for your hw?

Regards,
Oliver
