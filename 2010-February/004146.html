Yes. That was my intention.

I just wanted to say, that from the protocols view it is not relevant whether
an ECU ( == a CAN node) implements one or more ECUs.


&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> At the next level, j1939 describes a dynamic addressing scheme (the

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> addressing,
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> but let the kernel code follow the actions on the bus. Since a single

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> No.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I checked the idea of the Dynamic Address Configuration in SAE J1939 here

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> and this is definitely something that has to be handled outside the kernel.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Like I mentioned, the actions are taken in userspace, but the kernel
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> should track when a SA is valid and when not.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> And when it's not - what happens?
</I>&gt;<i> good question.
</I>&gt;<i> when dynamic addressing is used, then during the address claim 'dead

</I>&gt;<i> So, if such packet comes in, it _should_ be dropped/ignored.
</I>

Ah, i see.


&gt;&gt;<i> Is the socket collapsing after sending a socket error?
</I>&gt;<i> collapsing? I don't understand the word.
</I>

E.g. some sockets are set in an unusable state, when an error occurred on it's
specific transport protocol.

E.g. the userspace app get's a socket error on a socket (e.g. -ETIMEO(ut)) and
then you need to close this socket and create a new one, if you still want to
communicate ...


&gt;&gt;<i> So far i cannot see a value in putting the name into the kernel. When the
</I>&gt;<i> 2 packets from the same ECU may arrive. a regular socket user must be
</I>&gt;<i> able to recognize them as coming from the same ECU.
</I>&gt;<i> therefore, instead of relying on the SA, in dynamic addressing
</I>&gt;<i> environments, such user should rely on the name.
</I>&gt;<i> sending a packet to a particular ECU has the same issue. the same SA
</I>&gt;<i> does not necessarily address the same ECU.
</I>&gt;<i> To avoid delay problems, the mapping name-&gt;SA is done in kernel, in a
</I>&gt;<i> very late stage. But the kernel needs the names then.
</I>

Ok - comment follows.


&gt;&gt;<i> Finally (even if i do not like it) a socketoption containing the 64 bit name
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> can be placed into the socket as soon as it is created. Before or after bind()
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> is irrelevant.
</I>&gt;<i> for outgoing packets, that could be done.
</I>&gt;<i> and for incoming, one could create an extra ioctl.
</I>&gt;<i> but, it deviates from existing API's in a way I don't like.
</I>&gt;<i> Such API would suggest the SA in the sockaddr is reliable, which is not
</I>&gt;<i> always the case. To know that, an extra getsockopt or ioctl is needed.
</I>&gt;<i> bind(), connect(), recvfrom() &amp; sendto() all benefit from a proper
</I>&gt;<i> sockaddr _with_ the 64bit name.
</I>

Commented later.


&gt;<i> I feel that apart from dynamic addressing, we pretty much agree on
</I>&gt;<i> everything :-).
</I>

Yep :-)


&gt;<i> May I state this ?:
</I>&gt;<i> Doing proper dynamic addressing across several sockets/processes needs a
</I>&gt;<i> limited kernel knowledge. I don't contest the kernel's effort should be
</I>&gt;<i> minimal. Without kernel support, there are some mistakes that cannot be

</I>
Thanks for all you explanation. Indeed the 64 bit 'name' seems to be a vital
knowledge to ensure a proper dynamic address handling (&amp; recovery).

Btw. dynamic addressing is not an *essential* functionality for all J1939
applications, that only like to communicate using J1939 protocols, right?

Having

      struct {
         uint8_t sa, da;
         uint8_t priority;
         uint32_t pgn;
      } j1939;

and

      uint64_t name;

in /one/ structure IMO could lead to confusion and therefore to potential
misusage.

I would suggest to have the shown j1939 struct in sockaddr_can to handle the
J1939 communication without dynamic addressing.

By setting the uint64_t name with a socketoption the behaviour of the selected
socket changes in the way that ...

- the source address (sa) is set dynamically depending on the name
- the sockets data structures are updated according the dynamic addressing
- any other things that differ when using the J1939 name

Would this work for you?

Regards,
Oliver
