Hi Jan,

if your major concern is the porting from 'classic' CAN APIs and the
expectations from the masses please tell me why they should use
socket-can anyhow? Isn't Char-device enough? And which 'masses' are
considered here? The masses of CAN-programmers or the masses of
Socket-programmers?

 ;-) 

I think the right way is somewhere in between:

Define the CAN API for socket-can as clean as possible to behave like the
masses of Socket-programmers (its named socket-can!)  would expect but also
meet the needs of the guys porting from 'single user CAN' (a bit like legacy
support in other new technologies).

IMO the SUCPs (single user CAN programmers) expect not receiving what they
have sent on their socket. And the SUCPs do not think about other
applications on their machine - so the loopback does not affect them as they
do not recognize it (as SUCP). Maybe they recognize it later (and then they
will love it - e.g. using a candump tool locally).

The SPs (socket programmers) expect having on all sockets the same behaviour
to access the CAN and that they even get back the 'broadcasted' Frames
they've sent. (Yes, Urs expected this!)

So loopback is mandatory (and in the first glance not seen by SUCPs).
Receiving their own sent frames must be possible (to have a real
broadcast/multicast behaviour for SPs).

As most of the SUCPs getting in contact with socket-can will use the
RAW-socket first, it should be default NOT to receive the own sent frames to
meet the mostly expected behaviour. If there is a SP who want's it all, he
can use sockopt (he knows good).

Disabling loopback for one socket is a power-user feature to save resources
but breaks with the original CAN broadcasting idea. So at this point this
power-user also knows sockopts and can use it.

So the differences on both sides and the resulting defaults are clear to me:

Create two sockopts for CAN_RAW-specialists:
- one to disable loopback
- one to receive even the own sent frames


&gt;<i> &gt; IMOH, Socket-CAN should not try to evangelise users where it is not
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; required. Rather, it should provide clear interfaces to let them pick
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; /their/ preferred behaviour.
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>
Done!

Oliver

ps. Using mac.raw in my posted patch is working but now under investigation
of Urs if this would be the correct implementation of the idea, or if there
should be some other data-structures to be used ... i'll keep you in touch!
