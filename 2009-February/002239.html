&gt;<i> In the mean time I &quot;played&quot; with some normal diagnostic jobs and found an interesting fact: now the flow control frames are to fast for my testobject! As mentioned in my older emails, we used a python application on top of socketcan. We had times over 10ms between the first frame and the flow control frame on the CAN. Now I have times under 1ms and the car just ignores my flow control frame :(

Hm - AFAIK there is no lower limit for N_Br but only a performance 
requirement.

So after sending a FF or CF data frame the sender has to be able to 
receive the FC immediately ...


&gt;<i> I found the option frame_txtime, which is documented in isotp.h as N_As/N_Ar. Here is my question: how did you interpreted N_Ar in ISO 15765-2? I found some places in isotp.c where you set the tx_gap, but I'm not familiar enough with the socketcan-code to interpret it. When I look into the ISO, it seems to me that I have to set N_Br to some milliseconds to slow my application down to the speed of the ECU.
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>
The frame_txtime is the time the frame needs when sent onto the CAN bus.
This value is added to the value given by st_min from the receiver to 
meet the ISO spec. So it is used to slow down the data sending (CFs). It 
has no effect for FCs as there is no defined delay for FCs.

You might use frame_txtime to locally increase your own tx delay given 
by st_min from the receiver. But this also does not help to delay the 
FCs, sorry.

We flashed serveral ECUs with this implementation and never had the 
problem, that the ECUs had not been able to receive FCs after sending 
any data frames.

This looks weird :-(

Regards,
Oliver
