Is that really true. The manual states that an interrupt is generated
when the TXREQ bit will be cleared, which is the case for OSM after the
message has been sent. Otherwise it's a bad design flaw. But I might
have misinterpreted chapter 3.3. It would make sense to contact National
Instruments.

&gt;&gt;<i> Then i would tend to remove the OSM functionality as long as the driver is not

</I>
Yes, or at least do not add additional code. We need some more
experience with one-shot mode ..

But that's the same with all other CAN controllers. It's normal CAN

</I>
Reporting as much errors as possible to the user space is always a good
thing allowing the user/app to catch them and act upon (e.g. stop the
device). The hardware retrying to send a message is normal and I do not
see any need for a special treatment, especially not just by one driver.

&gt;&gt;<i> Regarding the missing tx interrupt the use of the &quot;standard netdev tx timeout&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> IMO could be the right approach to catch this *special* MCP251x problem. Btw.
</I>
Yes, that would be a possible solution.

Wolfgang.
