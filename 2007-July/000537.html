When I saw this first in linux-2.6 with all types of struct *_sock, I
felt the same way.  After reading the code a second and third time I
began to like it and find it quite clean.  It is to some extent the C
equivalent of inheritance, where the more specific subclasses get
their class members appended to the base class.

Is also resembles cascaded data structures where each level needs its
member at fixed offsets, like in network packet formats.  One could
write (ignoring the fact that IP cannot only be sent over ETH)

        struct eth_frame {
                struct eth_header;
        };

        struct ip_datagram {
                struct eth_frame;
                struct ip_header;
        };

        struct tcp_segment {
                struct ip_datagram;
                struct tcp_header;
        };

I know there are other nice ways of coding this, but I find this has
some beauty, also, although you can't reorder the struct members here.
I show this here, because in this code, probably no one would argue
that I can't reorder the struct members.  And if you think of the
private data for sja1000 as a specific type of can_priv data, like a
tcp_segment is a specific type of ip_datagram or like a tcp_sock is a
specific type of sock, then you might accept the fixed position of
struct can_priv inside struct sja1000_priv, also.

&gt;<i> We can pass around the net_device pointer and use it in the generic 
</I>&gt;<i> code, in the driver we can use container_of to get the surround sja1000 
</I>&gt;<i> struct. In this way we don't rely on things like, &quot;must be the first&quot;.
</I>
But then we can't rely in generic code like dev.c on finding struct
can_priv at a specific offset from netdev_priv(dev).  We would have no
way to get to the struct can_priv from *dev if we don't know what type
of driver we have and where it has placed this struct.

The previous code also had put the struct can_device at the beginning
of netdev_priv() and provided an additional *priv pointer to behind
the struct can_device, where the driver can put its own data.  This
pointer was set to &amp;can[1] where can is a pointer to the struct
can_device.  This means that, however, when struct can_priv has less
strict alignment requirements than the private struct of the specific
driver, that that struct could be misaligned (BTW, the kernel aligns
the netdev_priv() space to a multiple of 32 bytes).  We could play
some alignment tricks like

        can-&gt;priv = (char*)can[1] + NETDEV_ALIGN_CONST \
                                &amp; ~NETDEV_ALIGN_CONST;

but in the code I checked in today, the compiler will do this for us
automatically and as actually needed.

That's why I like the new code better than what we had previoulsy.
