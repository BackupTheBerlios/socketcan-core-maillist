I can follow your arguments.

But finally we should think about our new development process when the can-2.6
 git is established.

IMO the SVN becomes the place for people that need to run the CAN Subsystem on
older Kernels.

I assume driver developers would post patches against the new can-2.6 tree and
when they are accepted, we could think about taking them into the SVN also.
Finally the driver maintainer (or any user of this driver) can contribute the
support for older kernels, if needed.

And when the backward compatibility for the older kernel is selected &gt; 2.6.20
the ND2D() stuff becomes obsolete anyway ;-) - It's just a decision that needs
to be made by the driver maintainer or the driver user(s).

My 'ugly' approach would allow in many cases to apply mainline fixes directly
to the SVN which would be a major use-case for the 'backward compatible' SVN then.

Cheers,
Oliver
