Hi,

I think that trying to replace spi_sync with spi_async  in mcp251x.c
is like trying to replace the engine in a car: it's better to know a
bit about engines and cars otherwise the result will be a disaster.

That said it's a nice thing to rewrite the driver without the need of
deferred work (that is need by spi_sync) but be prepared to have a
rather complicated switch-based state machine to handle the
communications (I don't see other ways to do it). Think twice about
the various kinds of SPI drivers you will have beneath and how much
you will gain in performance and lose in term of interrupt latency of
the whole system. Especially the mcp2510 case will be quite
complicated. So I think you should post your code because it isn't
just a matter of &quot;M-X replace-string spi_sync spi_async&quot;, otherwise we
cannot help.

BTW: what motivates your work?
