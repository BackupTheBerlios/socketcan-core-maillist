Hi Chris,

*what if someone* is the right question. What if not? From all the 
discussions and feedbacks we settled on single-shot to be an interface 
configuration option. I think, there is no need to repeat the reasons 
again nor to discuss about the missing use-case. :-/

Btw. while (positively) searching a solution for you, i was thinking 
about some 'misusage' with CAN_XXX_FLAGs or to put any bit's into 
can_frame.can_dlc. But everthing had massive disadvantages or felt 
sticky and broken.

Remembering some early discussions about '16 mailboxes' on specific CAN 
controllers and how to deal with the information on which mailbox frames 
arrive or used to be sent or whatever, i was wondering if it could make 
sense to add a structure element 'priv' to the struct can_frame.

With this can_frame.priv we could transport per-frame information to and 
from the CAN driver that is use-case or hardware depended and not 
standardized at all. Some people would fill the mailbox numbers into 
can_frame.priv according their needs - some others (like you) would 
define themselves a bit for single-shot transmission per-frame.

So can_frame.priv is nothing that affects the common socket-API for CAN. 
It's just an information channel to and from the CAN controller, that 
would have a project depended meaning.

RFC: So what about a new __u8 can_frame.priv ?

Is it a bad hack?
Does it prevent bad hacks?
Does it create an uncontrollable 'shadow API' for CAN controllers?
Is it the right user-interface enhancement to support and allow project 
depended solutions?

The new struct can_frame would then look like this:

/**
* struct can_frame - basic CAN frame structure
* @can_id: the CAN ID of the frame and CAN_*_FLAG flags, see above.
* @can_dlc: the data length field of the CAN frame
* @priv: use-case specific additional frame information
* @data: the CAN frame payload.
*/
struct can_frame {
canid_t can_id; /* 32 bit CAN_ID + EFF/RTR/ERR flags */
__u8 can_dlc; /* data length code: 0 .. 8 */
__u8 priv; /* use-case specific frame information */
__u8 data[8] __attribute__((aligned(8)));
};

This additional struct element 'priv' may change the binary interface 
(on some archs) but there would be no need to change any existing source 
code.

Thanks &amp; regards,
Oliver
