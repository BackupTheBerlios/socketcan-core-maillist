Then I guess the main thing that a &quot;smart&quot; CAN implementation like pruss
should do is interrupt mitigation. When you have a constant flow of
packets coming in, the hardware should be able to DMA a lot of
them into kernel memory before the driver is required to pick them up,
and only get into interrupt driven mode when the kernel has managed
to process all outstanding packets.

&gt;<i> This all depends heavily on Linux networking (skb handling, caching, etc) and

Right, dropping packets that no process is waiting for should be done as
early as possible. In pruss-can, the idea was to do it in hardware, which
doesn't really work all that well for the reasons discussed before.
Dropping the frames in the NAPI poll function (softirq time) seems like a
logical choice.

</I>
Makes sense.
