Yes. And i also think that the bus-error interrupt is a special case that 
leads us into problems that are not vital for the general description of the

API. From my knowlege only the BEI is exploding in that way until the 
CAN-communication breaks in pieces.

So for me it was the 'wanted behaviour' to restart the chip after numerous 
BEIs. And it works fine. Even getting 16 fast following error frames was not
a 
problem.

Yep! So please check how you really want to deal with BEIs, because they are

not very informative to the user (only for logging purposes) BUT they might
be 
important to restart the controller. On application side you should be 
informed when things went wrong, e.g. from a restarted controller and 
(therefore) lost CAN-frames. But all these problems might not be recognized 
within your single RT-slot.

So the design has to cover this f*cking CAN-behaviour.

I will make a proposal for changes in can_error.h and can_ioctl.h regarding 
the Mailings of today tomorrow morning. This has to be settled over night
and 
with some beer in front of the TV this evening ;-)
