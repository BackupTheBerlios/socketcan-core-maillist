What about a driver config switch allowing either to freeze the access
method at compile time or make it load-time switchable per device? If
you are playing with different hardware or have different types on the
same system, the flexible variant can be set. For production systems
with a single hardware type you could then optimise it.

Console switching is known to be a potential problem for any RT system,
I see this from time to time on my notebook with an ATI Radeon 7500 as
well. Also X acceleration can kill you, we faced this recently over a
VIA chipset.

AFAIK, high-res timers do not work yet over ARM. Cannot say if this has
any effect on your test scenario. Likely not if you only react on CAN
IRQs and have no timed RT jobs.

What ARM sub-arch is your board?

&gt;<i> ...
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Cannot say if this limitation to one CAN port is too restrictive in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> practice. The only use-case I have in mind ATM which may require to spit
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> out frames to multiple ports is redundant transmission.

</I>&gt;<i> My original idea has been based on connection of file handle

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I think, that write/read/send/recv or even vector variants are good

</I>
There is &quot;normal&quot; ioctl and unlocked_ioctl in 2.6. The former takes the
BKL, what is latency-wise not quite beneficial. But also my favourite is
not IOCTL, rather read/write or a separate proto type.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Regarding the receiving:
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I don't know if the receiving of more than one CAN-Frame with one read
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> syscall is at least a wanted usecase (please check this first!). But if
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> it is (and there is a socket-option that enables the receiving of more
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> than one CAN-Frame at a time), there are IMO two possibilities to deal
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> e.g. with timestamps when receiving more than one CAN-Frame:
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> o the timestamp you can get with ioctl() reflects only one (of x)
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> CAN-Frames (the easy way)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The first one would be best then. When you are interested in timestamps
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> for a stream, it is to my experience almost always its beginning. [This
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> is also how our real-time serial device API works.]
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> o the timestamp is part of your suggested enhanced message format struct
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> (covering the CAN-Frame, the timestamp and the ifindex).
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Or maybe there are two new socket options for the RAW-Socket:
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 1. Enable to read more than one CAN-Frame with one read() syscall on this
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> RAW-Socket
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 2. Switch this RAW-Socket to the suggested 'enhanced message format' (RX
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> &amp; TX)
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> In the TX-case the timestamp of the enhanced message is ignored and the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> ifindex is only used if the socket is not bound to any ifindex ...
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> What do you think?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> This all depends on the scenario. Let's try to categorise:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  1. sending or receiving  a stream of frames over a single port (e.g.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     Pavel's drive commands or our Ibeo scanner)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  2. sending or receiving frames for redundancy reasons over several
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     ports (should this be handled at application or kernel level?)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  3. receiving frames from all ports, maybe also being interested in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     timestamps (traffic sniffer)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> If we push 2. into the kernel and let 3. suffer, we could get away with
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> a &quot;cheap&quot; solution based on the existing can_frame - unless there are
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> other demanding scenarios...
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Pavel, what scenarios did you encounter so far for multi-frame
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> transmission/reception? Are all covered by the list above?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I would vote for can frame with timestamp to eliminate IOCTLs
</I>&gt;<i> and to have info for each of them. I am not sure about interface.
</I>
You don't need an IOCTL to obtain timestamps with Socket-CAN. They can
also come via msg.msg_control.

&gt;<i> I would probably prefer that socket is associated to one interface
</I>&gt;<i> during its active lifetime to prevent some flooding from
</I>&gt;<i> killing all networks from one broken thread. On the other hand,
</I>&gt;<i> there should be reserved some place to store info about message
</I>&gt;<i> box number inside chip (full CAN concept), because it cannot be
</I>&gt;<i> fully hidden for some controllers from application.
</I>
Well, I think if we already add information that is not in can_frame, we
should add the full program.
