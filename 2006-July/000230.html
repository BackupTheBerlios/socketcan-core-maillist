</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>No, I haven't see any problem, since all communication with phy should
be providing by platform/board driver
(mpc52xx_can as ex.), so mscan itself worked only with onboard memory
mapped registers and all.
It should, certainly, call some callbacks in some functions (in
do_set_bittime is undoubtedly).
Also, as I pointed in changelog, mscan currently is a dedicated _onchip_
subsystem so you could not
load more than one driver based on mscan (it certainly is not SJA1000 case).
&gt;<i> eg.
</I>&gt;<i> insmod cantrx-myhardware.ko drv=mscan,mscan drvio=0xf0000900,0xf0000980 
</I>&gt;<i> drvunit=1,1 base=0xf0003000,0xf0004000 irq=24,25
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>So for a mscan based driver it will be something like:

 modprobe drv=mpc52xx .....

(phy related staff will be filled in by platform driver)

or may be

modprobe sja1000_core.ko .....
modprobe my_sja1000_based_board_driver.ko .....
modprobe my_another_sja1000_based_board_driver.ko .....

for a SJA1000 based boards, but in this case phy staff is a board specific,
and, IMHO, should be implemented in board specific part of driver.
 

&gt;<i> Which could mean, that the cantrx-myhardware scans all the netdevice drivers
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> to find 'mscan'-type drivers. Then it has to find the correct entity: So we 
</I>&gt;<i> check on the iospace address to find the concrete controller. If there are 
</I>&gt;<i> CAN-Controllers that have many entities inside we might need to have a 
</I>&gt;<i> distinction like 'drvunit'.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The 'base' and 'irq' are commandline options for the cantrx-myhardware
</I>&gt;<i> module 
</I>&gt;<i> itself (optional - if needed for this driver!)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>Not for a mscan case. For it you always know which registers/interrupts
will be used.

&gt;<i> What do you think on this idea?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>I currently playing with phy on our board, and I found that best way to
implement phy drivers
as a library module, but not separate loadable module (since it _very_
hardware dependent).
