<PRE>Hi Oliver,

&gt;<i> Hi Andrey,

&gt;<i> i'm a little confused on the current actions taking place here, so maybe you

</I>
Berlios's svn will be more then sufficient for a 2.4 and user
space software, since nobody, but we will change it officially
(or it will occur rarely).

But, as Robert has told before, place of 2.6 sources is questionable,
since berlios/sf didn't provide git service :(,
(I don't demand that they must be only on our site,
they may be anywhere) and constant git&lt;-&gt;svn resynchronization
(once at kernel release as a minimum) will be, IMHO, painful,
perhaps not for us, but for another kernel stuff maintainer for sure.
Also, don't forget, most of us are working on another kernel
drivers/subsystems too (_git_ based), so hold up locally
different copies of kernel for a different, but sometime crossing,
projects is, to put it mildly, a little inconvenient ;).

&gt;<i> On this list we had a heavy discussion on the Socket-API up to the end of
</I>&gt;<i> February to define basic things like:
</I>
&gt;<i> - The struct can_frame
</I>&gt;<i> - The filters
</I>&gt;<i> - The socket options
</I>&gt;<i> - The socket bindings
</I>&gt;<i> - The sockaddr_can
</I>
&gt;<i> From a discussion with Marc, Robert, Jan, etc. we defined the current
</I>&gt;<i> Socket-API and that 'the VW guys' would continue the work on the 'framework'
</I>&gt;<i> that holds different CAN-protocols and integrates the PF_CAN.
</I>&gt;<i> On the other side 'the Pengutronix guys' are working closer on CAN-drivers
</I>&gt;<i> and tools (like the Ethereal-Plugin, etc).
</I>But we skipped CAN error problem, which Wolfgang raised a week ago,
so content of can_frame is _already_ modified.
Also I changed behaviour of the baudrate-related stuff, and I want to publish it,
but to _which_ source I should make the patch :)?

&gt;<i> Now you are putting things to somewhere ('git') derived from the former
</I>&gt;<i> style of the Socket-API on the Pengutronix-SVN. Hm.
</I>Quotation from my prev message: &quot;and Urs don't answer on our
requests&quot;, I agree that Pengutronix-SVN slightly deprecated, but it is
useful as a common base for synchronization of everybody's work.

&gt;<i> So the current idea is to created on the berlios-SVN some kind of directory
</I>&gt;<i> structure:
</I>
&gt;<i> doc
</I>&gt;<i> src
</I>&gt;<i> src/kernel - for the kernel source
</I>&gt;<i> src/apps   - for applications like candump, cansend, etc.
</I>&gt;<i> src/lib    - for plugins like Ethereal
</I>&gt;<i> src/test   - for programs to check the CAN-Framework
</I>
&gt;<i> src/kernel/2.4
</I>&gt;<i> src/kernel/2.6
</I>
&gt;<i> src/kernel/2.[46]/can     - to be put in linux/net/can
</I>&gt;<i> src/kernel/2.[46]/drivers - to be put in linux/drivers/net/can
</I>
&gt;<i> src/kernel/2.[46]/drivers/sja1000 - to be put in
</I>&gt;<i> linux/drivers/net/can/sja1000
</I>&gt;<i> src/kernel/2.[46]/drivers/mscan   - ... and so on
</I>
maybe better:
/src/kernel/2.4       &lt;- full 2.4 head snapshot + CAN
/src/can-utils/....   &lt;- userspace only
/doc                  &lt;- only common docos for all subtrees
                      (like socket whitepaper) is pushed here
/www                  Who would like to create it?

&gt;<i> ...
</I>&gt;<i> The source in src/kernel/2.6 may contain code that depends on the
</I>&gt;<i> KERNEL_VERSION so that there is only one code to work on.
</I>&gt;<i> To create a patch
</I>&gt;<i> (for git?) there should be some kind of script that creates a fixed
</I>&gt;<i> kernel-version patch (e.g. for 2.6.16).
</I>I voted for branches.

&gt;<i> As you may have seen in other mails, Urs is working on the SVN upload of the
</I>&gt;<i> proposed directory structure, which should be done tommorow.
</I>Ok, it would be nice.

&gt;<i> So i think, it would be a really good job to continue the discussion on the
</I>&gt;<i> basis of the berlios-SVN ...
