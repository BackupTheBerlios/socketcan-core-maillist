</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Sooner than later the upstream maintainers would like to deal just
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; with *one* maintainer, I'm afraid. But we are not yet that far.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;   
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; This is no real issue. Search the MAINTAINERs file for 'NETWORK' and 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; you'll see, that there are maintainers for single network drivers as 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; well as for complete network layers. E.g.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; grep -A2 AX.25 MAINTAINERS
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; So it is not even usual to tunnel all the stuff via one single
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; person. When there is much upstream traffic it makes sense to cluster
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; things - like Jeff Garzik does for the net drivers. But this is a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; floating process and i can't see why we should expose a single person
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; for all the CAN stuff.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, that's neither necessary nor desirable. One person can be ill, on
</I>&gt;<i> holidays, or occupied by other work.
</I>Most of the kernel subsystems rely on a single person today.
The net subsystem rely solely on David Miller for example. There are
obvious lots of contributors behing David - the can people is some of them.
But to get -net stuff into the kernel we all rely on David to do his
share of the work.

&gt;<i> IMO, the important thing is &quot;one
</I>&gt;<i> place&quot;, not &quot;one person&quot;. There should be one and only one repository
</I>&gt;<i> (be it git, svn, quilt queue or whatever) where one can get the latest
</I>&gt;<i> state of socketcan stuff.
</I>Two places I would say. The latest stabilized stuff can be found
in the mainline kernel.
The stuff planned for the next merge window can be found
in another place.

Again - this is the model used by many subsytems in the kernel
with success and CAN is not special here.

And based on other comments on this list is seems
that driver stuff will be serate from core CAN stuff and that
core CAN stuff may only be found in -net (and mainline kernel)
which is again what other subsystems often do - so this is a
known model.
