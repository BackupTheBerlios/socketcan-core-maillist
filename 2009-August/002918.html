Hi Maximilian,

it took two nights to come back with a proper feedback from my side ;-)

The first thing is, that you should tweak the serial buffer side when you like
to ensure that your serial device does not get flooded with data.

AFAICS this is done by the code above and the defined SLC_MTU:

  /* maximum rx buffer len: extended CAN frame with timestamp */
  #define SLC_MTU (sizeof(&quot;T1111222281122334455667788EA5F\r&quot;)+1)

The second and more important thing is, that i assume this bscan driver
approach to end in an unmaintainable state always clashing with the slcan
driver. The bscan driver creates something like slcan 1.5 using N_SLCAN and
especially does not add any really new functionality.

It would be an interesting (and new) idea to create a complete concept of a
'remote style generic CAN controller driver' that uses the CAN driver
interface, all the netlink stuff for bitrate setting, etc. - but bscan does
not do this.

Btw. the idea to reduce the serial line data load by providing a binary data
encapsulation would be a valuable add-on for the slcan driver approach.

As you stated correctly the bottleneck is the efficient transfer of CAN frames
on the serial line. Therefore i would focus on this data transfer in detail
and let all the other commands like 'O' and 'S2' as they are (in ASCII).

The CAN frame encapsulation (with 'T', 't', 'R' and 'r') could be enhanced by
a binary mode that works like this:

ASCII mode (12 bytes):
t4563112233\r : can_id 0x456, can_dlc 3, data 0x11 0x22 0x33

Binary mode (7 bytes):
t&lt;04&gt;&lt;56&gt;&lt;03&gt;&lt;11&gt;&lt;22&gt;&lt;33&gt;

ASCII mode (15 bytes):
T12ABCDEF2AA55\r : extended can_id 0x12ABCDEF, can_dlc 2, data 0xAA 0x55

Binary mode (8 bytes):
T&lt;12&gt;&lt;AB&gt;&lt;CD&gt;&lt;EF&gt;&lt;02&gt;&lt;AA&gt;&lt;FF&gt;

To distinguish the two modes you can look into the first byte after [TtRr]:

When this is an ASCII number (which can only be '0' .. '7' for CAN IDs) you
have something like 0x30 .. 0x37 =&gt; 0x3? as hex value here.

When you have the binary mode, you get values like this in the first byte:

0x00 .. 0x07 for SFF frames
0x00 .. 0x1F for EFF frames

but *never* something like 0x3? ...

So it's no problem to have an ASCII encapsulation and a binary encapsulation i
parallel using the slcan protocol. Cool ey?

The question remains, how switch the slcan encapsulation:

1. Add a module parameter 'dflt_bin_encaps=1' so that the slcan driver would
know from the first sending attempt of CAN frames, that he should use the
binary encapsulation.

2. Implement some kind of automatic detection:

When slcan receives a binary CAN frame (see above) =&gt; switch to binary (also
on the TX side).

The problem here is, when you do not receive frames but only send all the time ...

In this case your CAN adapter must be able to decode the ASCII CAN frames
also. When your CAN adapter receives an ASCII encapsulated frame, it could
send a notification, that he's capable to support binary frames.

E.g. by sending

t&lt;0F&gt;&lt;FF&gt;&lt;00&gt;

This would switch the slcan driver to the binary mode (see above) but the
frame itself would be discarded as 0xFFF is not a valid CAN identifier.

Puh. Much text - but it hopefully was worth the effort ;-)

What do you thing about this kind of binary encapsulation for the slcan driver?

Regards,
Oliver
