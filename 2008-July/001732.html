</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The problem is that the equations have more than one solution. So there
</I>&gt;<i> may be different combinations which lead to the *same* bittime.
</I>
Yes, sure. But the number of solutions is small. You can choose by
making additional requirements, e.g. &quot;sample point near 87.5%&quot;.

It is clear that the solution delivered by that algorithm might not be
suitable for each and every application, that's why we all agree that
userspace should be able to set sync, prop, phase1, and phase2 manually.

To enable userspace to perform its own calculations, we must provide the
chip specific capabilities/limitations I mentioned above.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> We've done it for the MPC5200's MSCAN. What you have to do is to make a
</I>&gt;<i> really big table (we did that in OpenOffice Calc) and do a minimum
</I>&gt;<i> search on the remaining errors; in fact, it is multiple such searches
</I>&gt;<i> for different sets of input parameters.
</I>
I thought about something like this:

- For all possible numbers of time quanta (usually 8 to 25), calculate
  the necessary divider settings. Rule out those where the divider is
  not within min_div to max_div. Choose the number of time quanta where
  the bittime error is minimal.

- Choose sync, prop, phase1, phase2 according to recommendations.

&gt;<i> So definitely nothing you want
</I>&gt;<i> to do in the kernel. And what do you do if you get more than one result?
</I>&gt;<i> Somebody has to decide.
</I>
You choose the solution that's nearest to the recommendations.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Our conclusion was:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> - Variant a): use the default set of bit timing parameters (CiA values)
</I>&gt;<i> - Variant b): let the user define his own parameters, on a per-bitrate
</I>&gt;<i>   base (we do that in /etc/network/interfaces).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The driver itself does only see the bit timing parameter set and has to
</I>&gt;<i> transform that to corresponding register values. No need for tables in
</I>&gt;<i> the driver.
</I>
Yes, agreed.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; If all the values metioned above and the bittimings (sync, prop,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; phase1, phase2) are available in sysfs, there is no _need_ for any
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; userspace tools or libraries. It's just convenient, and if the kernel
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to userspace interface is designed properly, all versions of such
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; tools or libraries should always work with every kernel. Without
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; having to know the chip type.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Right, seconded.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Vladislav Gribov made some suggestions for a userspace table system, I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; really don't understand why his concept is ignored.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Maybe this discussion grew too large in the meantime :)
</I>
That could be a reason, right ;-)

Thanks,
Hans
