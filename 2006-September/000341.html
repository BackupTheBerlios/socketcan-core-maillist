<PRE>Dear audience,

i've been thinking about the integration of the socketcan source into 
the kernel-tree and compared our current filestructure to the common 
understanding which is used under include/linux.

The current structure contains:

include/linux/can/af_can.h
(PF_CAN, CAN_XXX protos , sockaddr, filters, af_can.c function 
prototypes, af_can.c datastructures)

include/linux/can/bcm.h
(protocol specific stuff, e.g. sockopts)

include/linux/can/can.h
(ETH_P_CAN, ARPHRD_CAN, struct can_frame)

include/linux/can/can_error.h
(error frame definitions)

include/linux/can/can_ioctl.h
(ioctl definitions)

include/linux/can/raw.h
(protocol specific stuff, e.g. sockopts)

include/linux/can/version.h
(API? version information)

net/can/can_device.h
(can_device.c function prototypes for candev.ko)

In the 'integrated' case some things are moved:
PF_CAN -&gt; include/linux/socket.h
ETH_P_CAN -&gt; include/linux/if_ether.h
ARPHRD_CAN -&gt; include/linux/if_arp.h

My suggestion is to merge things together so that the 'standard-user' 
only would need to include 'can.h' that covers anything can.ko is 
providing. Additionally can.h itself should be placed in include/linux 
and 'special' CAN-dependent things should be placed in include/linux/can 
directory. E.g. hdlc.h / isdn.h handles it the same way with additional 
directories having similar names.

So my suggestion would be:

include/linux/can.h (mainly for can-users)
(struct can_frame, sockaddr_can, can_filters, CAN_XXX protos, error 
frame definitions, API? Version definition - and until moved out: 
PF_CAN, ETH_P_CAN, ARPHRD_CAN)

include/linux/can/bcm.h (mainly for can-users)
(protocol specific stuff, e.g. sockopts)

include/linux/can/raw.h (mainly for can-users)
(protocol specific stuff, e.g. sockopts)

include/linux/can/device.h (mainly for can-driver programmers / 
(ioctl-)superusers)
(can_device.c function prototypes for candev.ko, ioctl definitions)

include/linux/can/core.h (mainly for can-protocol programmers using the 
can.ko core)
(af_can.c function prototypes, af_can.c datastructures which are shared 
with proc.c)

That's it.

Additionally net/can/af_can.c may be renamed to net/can/core.c
and net/can/can_device.c may be renamed to /net/can/device.c

IMO this cleans up the historic includes-landscape and points out 
clearly what include i would need for what functionality.

What do you think? Any concerns? Any applause?

Best regards,

Oliver
