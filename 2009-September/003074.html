</I>This option is not different to directly work on net-next-2.6.

&gt;&gt;<i> 2. Setup a full can-2.6 git tree with *all* drivers from the SVN
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    repository (excluding the old ones). That's a significant maintenance
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    effort, especially to provide compatibility with older versions.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> IMO it does not make any sense to maintain backward compatible code in a brand
</I>&gt;<i> new kernel tree environment ...
</I>Ack.

&gt;&gt;<i> 3. Move the out-of-tree code from the BerliOS SVN repository to git.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    That's a valuable option, indeed.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Ack.
</I>So we have the benefits to have a local repository were the developer can work on
and creating and submitting patches becomes easier. Would be fine.

&gt;<i> For me the current process could be:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> * For new drivers (like ems_usb.c):
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1. Post source as a diff to net-next-2.6 on SocketCAN Core ML
</I>&gt;<i> 2. Make some reviews. Still needed changes: goto 1
</I>&gt;<i> 3. Post source as a diff to net-next-2.6 on netdev ML
</I>&gt;<i> 4. Make some reviews. Still needed changes: goto 1 or 3
</I>&gt;<i> 5. Acked-by: Wolfgang
</I>&gt;<i> 6. Done Mainlining
</I>&gt;<i> 7. Apply source to out-of-tree-repository
</I>&gt;<i> 8. Add backward compatibility stuff
</I>&gt;<i> 9. Done
</I>I don't like 8. This sounds simple for a simple network driver, but becomes un-
maintainable for complex drivers like an USB device driver or PCMCIA board.

&gt;<i> * For drivers that are only in the out-of-tree-repository:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1. Post patches as a diff to out-of-tree-repository on SocketCAN Core ML
</I>&gt;<i> 2. Make some reviews. Still needed changes: goto 1
</I>&gt;<i> 3. Apply to the out-of-tree-repository
</I>&gt;<i> 4. Done
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> * For drivers that are in Mainline (and in the out-of-tree-repository):
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Post the patches/fixes for the Mainline driver as described in the process for
</I>&gt;<i> new drivers.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> * To mainline drivers that are currently only in the out-of-tree-repository:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Create a source from the out-of-tree-repository with strip-src and follow the
</I>&gt;<i> process for new drivers.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This should make it.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> And in most cases the developer can post git-patches based on net-next-2.6
</I>&gt;<i> which becomes the leading development repository.
</I>Great.

&gt;<i> It is no big difference then whether the out-of-tree-repository is a SVN or a
</I>&gt;<i> GIT then. I could live with both of them.
</I>It's not a difference for you, I know. ;-) But I guess persons without write
access to SVN prefer a local GIT repository to better keep track of their
modifications and submitting their patches.

&gt;<i> Looks the described process sane to all of you?
</I>Let summarize:
Work on already mainlined drivers or new drivers is done on net-next-2.6. Not yet
mainlined drivers becomes ready for mainlining in the out-of-tree repository which
we move to GIT.

Ok for me.

There is another option (just a thought worth). The staging-tree is indented for
drivers which are not yet ready for kernel inclusion. This criteria matches for all
currently not yet mainlined drivers. Why not moving them to the staging tree so
we have all drivers in net-next-2.6? This would also increase the audience of kernel
developers which may take look at this drivers to help us, getting them out of staging?

Cheers, Sebastian
