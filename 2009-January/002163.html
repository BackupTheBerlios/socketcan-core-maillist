The slcan devices give a very abstract view on the CAN.

Indeed the common commands that make sense to be converted by a line 
discipline are converting the CAN frames (like slip.c (de-)encapsulates 
IP packets). slcan devices are low-cost devices with a very limited 
access to controller specific stuff.

Please see <A HREF="http://download.berlios.de/socketcan/SLCAN-API.pdf">http://download.berlios.de/socketcan/SLCAN-API.pdf</A>

You don't have access to 'arbitration lost' information or things like this.

If we try to apply the SYSFS file idea on slcan class interfaces we can 
not provide the hw independent bitrate setting, as we do not know 
*which* slcan adaptor is attached to the serial line. E.g. the CANhack 
and the CAN232 adaptor have different BTR registers.

Maybe i'm too lazy to think more about this - but there is a solution 
attaching slcan devices, and these devices are a bunch of adaptors and 
you don't know it's detailed capabilities when attaching them. The only 
thing that /could/ be interesting would be to set the bitrate as long as 
it fit's to the list of supported bitrates.

Of course when we have 'good' USB CAN devices like the PEAK USB CAN 
adaptor, that can provides detailed SJA1000 register information, it has 
to use the CAN netdev library! The PEAK USB hardware is a good example 
where to use it.

But slcan driver class and the vcan driver are drivers that do not have 
any advantage to use the CAN netdev library ...

Oliver
