</I>Looks good, but it contains some redundant information. 
Do we really need drvname and ioport in the canhwid?

Some interfaces have a user configurable id string. 
This one could be contained in the canhwid somehow.
But how to set it? Or is this a totally different issue?

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> For the &quot;+5V on Pin1&quot; use-case i would tend to a vendor specific
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> /sys/class/net/can0/enable_5v_on_pin1
</I>Ok. This could solve the user configurable id string
issue above as well.

It seems that the canhwid is the only common thing for all
CAN nets. So this one should be handled commonly by candev, right?
So perhaps a new function pointer field in struct can_priv to get the  
canhwid?
