I follow Jan. It looks like that the current projects Dave and Patrick
implement on their own and all the daily impacts from the netdev mailing
list are looking more interesting or urging to them. So i can imagine
that the socketcan stuff is not the 'hottest' thing for them. Btw. i
cannot see, how/why this could change the next ten years :-(

</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>
Yes, that's probably the best way. Ask if we may have forgot anything to
address (and that the patched still work fine on his net-2.6.24 git).

@Thomas/Hans-J&#252;rgen: Do you have any good advice? I just tapped into
some traps due to misunderstood emails (as i did not get my intentions
properly into the English language). This lead e.g. to

<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/pipermail/socketcan-users/2007-August/000180.html">https://lists.berlios.de/pipermail/socketcan-users/2007-August/000180.html</A> ,

the attached mail from Urs (not in the mail archive for any reason)
and the last reposting of the source three weeks ago:

<A HREF="http://marc.info/?l=linux-netdev&amp;m=118619408431318&amp;w=2">http://marc.info/?l=linux-netdev&amp;m=118619408431318&amp;w=2</A>

As there had been no feedback at all, i additionally thought about
creating some SocketCAN 'Design-FAQ' (maybe in PDF slides) to explain
questions like

- What is CAN?
- How is the addressing on a CAN network?
- How is it realized in socketcan?
- Which data is transported in the skb's?
- Which kernel networking functionality is used?
- How is the multiuser access realized?
- Is the CAN loopback functionality similar to the loopback device? (NO!)
- etc.

Most of these questions have just been answered in
Documentation/networking/can.txt e.g. at
<A HREF="http://marc.info/?l=linux-netdev&amp;m=118619408603665&amp;w=2">http://marc.info/?l=linux-netdev&amp;m=118619408603665&amp;w=2</A> but maybe it has
to be made easier to understand to help Dave to get a fast introduction
and to motivate him to review the code.
 
Best regards,
Oliver
