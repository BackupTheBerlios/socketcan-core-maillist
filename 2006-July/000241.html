<PRE>Hi Andrey,

maybe i wrote some things that could be misunderstood.

The idea was NOT to define command line parameters for the mscan-controller 
(that is built in) BUT for a hardware dependent module that only(!) treats 
with transceivers.

So my idea was to leave the mscan/sja1000/whatever driver untouched and load
a 
module, that is hardware dependent, to control the transceivers. Such kind
of 
transceiver-module has to 'find' the associated CAN-controller-driver and
has 
to provide some call-back-routines, so that the CAN-controller-driver can
set 
the transceivers into the wanted states (e.g. sleep-mode).

I don't know if this is too sophisticated and if we really should have 
multifle myhw_mscan.ko to support different
transceiver-hardware-attachments.

So maybe you can give me your opinion to my first Mailing now knowing what i

meant to describe ...

Regards,

Oliver
