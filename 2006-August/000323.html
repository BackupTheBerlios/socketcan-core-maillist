</I>
Urs, please, we were already a step further in the discussion. You don't
have to follow the path I took on first rush-in.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Basically, delivering sent packets not only to a CAN interface but
</I>&gt;<i> also loop it back to sockets listening on the local host is the
</I>&gt;<i> correct behavior.  Why should several process running on other
</I>&gt;<i> machines see the packet while other processes running on the local
</I>&gt;<i> machine don't see them?
</I>
As stated in the thread: because not everyone sees and uses the CAN API
as a network layer protocol interface.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If a packet is sent to only one recipient it should be routed to only
</I>&gt;<i> that recipient, when it's multicasted or broadcasted, any socket
</I>&gt;<i> registered for that packet should get it.  CAN is by definition a
</I>&gt;<i> broadcast network, there is no way to send unicast or multicast
</I>&gt;<i> packets. 
</I>
It is multicast when your CAN adapter allows to configure filter masks
appropriately - just like some Ethernet adapters do while others don't.

&gt;<i> Therefore, all packets should be received by all listening
</I>&gt;<i> sockets, be it on a remote host or the local host.  I am surprised
</I>&gt;<i> someone would expect otherwise, keeping in mind that CAN is by
</I>&gt;<i> definition broadcast and does not even have something like addresses.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Having a mechanism to disable packets to local sockets for performance
</I>&gt;<i> reasons might be valuable like IP does with the IP_MULTICAST_LOOP
</I>&gt;<i> socket option.

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> At least for IP multicast, there is no such filtering, only the socket

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> No.  IP_MULTICAST_LOOP is a per socket option, not per host.  You can
</I>&gt;<i> well have sockets with IP_MULTICAST_LOOP enabled and other sockets

</I>&gt;<i> how we should implement it for CAN, too.  We should have a
</I>&gt;<i> CAN_RAW_LOOP (or maybe CAN_LOOP) socket option to control this
</I>&gt;<i> behavior.
</I>
&quot;Per host&quot; might have been the wrong term, and that's maybe why you
missed what I was talking about here: the filtering of looped-back
messages to the sender socket.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Currently, I am somewhat undecided wether we need another option to
</I>&gt;<i> control if a socket should get back its own packets.  First, my
</I>&gt;<i> preference was not to have it in order to not bloat the API
</I>&gt;<i> description, now I think it may be useful to meet the different
</I>&gt;<i> expectations expressed in this discussion.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Protocols look more handy too me (from a user POV) and are easier
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> acceptable if we really go for default on. Socket options are not that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> well visible, and we should better reduce the level of surprise.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> But let's ask for other opinions:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> POLL 1: How to control TX loopback behaviour?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 	[ ] socket option
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 	[ ] two protocols
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 	[ ] .................
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 	    (please describe)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It should definitely be a socket option, since this is not another
</I>&gt;<i> protocol.  It's only a minor optional change in behavior of the
</I>&gt;<i> socket, i.e. a socket option.
</I>
Again, that heavily depends on the POV regarding what the CAN interface
should provide. If you compare the network-layer with the link-layer
views, it is kind of a different protocol (though with only minor
semantic and more noticeable runtime differences). Therefore, protocol
IDs describe clearer these varying views, and they do it far more
prominently then a socket option.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> POLL 2: What should be the default behaviour?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 	[ ] loopback
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 	[ ] no loopback
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Since we are talking about a multiuser and multitasking system where
</I>&gt;<i> many processes run on the same machine, several of which may use CAN
</I>&gt;<i> sockets, IMO the default should be to do loopback, so that different
</I>&gt;<i> sockets in different processes can see packets generated by other
</I>&gt;<i> sockets.  If one knows he's the only one on the system using a CAN
</I>&gt;<i> socket (or a CAN socket bound to some specific CAN ID), he can disable
</I>&gt;<i> the default behaviour with the socket option.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
Don't forget the masses of user porting over from &quot;classic&quot; CAN APIs.
They don't expect loopback, they likely don't care about it (until
someone tells them that it can cause workload/WCET spikes for their
use-cases), they are mostly interested in similar interfaces.

IMOH, Socket-CAN should not try to evangelise users where it is not
required. Rather, it should provide clear interfaces to let them pick
/their/ preferred behaviour.
