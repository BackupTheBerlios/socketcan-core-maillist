To maintain a subsystem does not stringently mean, that you need to be 
the gate for all CAN related patches and a maintainer for a GIT repository.

Indeed i feel very good with the solution that Urs and me are 
maintaining the network-layer of the CAN subsystem (net/can/*) and that 
Wolfgang (thankfully) took the task to bring the drivers 
(drivers/net/can/*) together. As you might have seen last year, i'm not 
the one that run's away from work or responsibility or is not available 
for discussions.

The vast majority of my personal SocketCAN effort moved into my spare 
time as i'm not able to run GIT behind the VW firewall and there is 
other project work to do. Tracking the ongoing networking activities, 
maintaining the CAN-networklayer stuff and several user-apps on the 
BerliOS SVN and finally having fruitful discussions on this mailinglist 
is a nice kind of work - every evening.

For my work inside the CAN network-layer posting patches to Davem on the 
netdev-ML works perfectly fine. But for the ongoing activities i assume 
the major work to be done in the CAN _drivers_ section.

Even when the mail from Sam encouraged me a lot (thanks!), i would 
prefer someone else to set up a GIT tree (at kernel.org or at 
[pengutronix|linutronix|denx].de) to collect the CAN driver stuff, 
frequently re-base the tree and request git-pulls on the netdev-ML.

I hope i was able to make my motivation and my main focus transparent to 
you. And of course i'd like to stay the maintainer of the CAN 
network-layer stuff as described in linux/MAINTAINERS :-)

Thanks &amp; regards,
Oliver
