Just to emphasize my point a bit: I find it REALLY BAD to have hardware
specific stuff in our interface to userspace EVEN if it is only an
addition for experts (whatever that means).

Reason: If people start writing decent userspace tools or libraries for
socketcan, they will of course want to support _all_ features. They'll
write libraries to convert hardware independent settings to hardware
specific ones and vice versa. These libraries will become large, and
each time you add a new driver, you need to update it, and notify all
users, otherwise their software will work with one hardware but not with
an other.

Alright, bitrate calculations can easily be half the code of a socketcan
driver (and 90% of the time needed to write it), and it's tempting to
push that to userspace and leave the problem to others. But I think the
price is too high: SocketCAN might get the reputation that it only works
if you have the right combination of kernel, library, and tools.

</I>
Oh no, don't! It was just a quick hack to make things work, and probably
needs to be rewritten completely. E.g. you might get integer overflows
in the calculations if certain assumptions regarding clock frequencies
are not met. I also wrote it with just the at91 in mind, dunno if it can
be simply used for other controllers.

But it cannot be sooo difficult to write such a function properly...

Thanks,
Hans
