&gt;<i> OK, so far you and Urs have been happy with the loopback solution in the 
</I>&gt;<i> Linux socket-can driver and you didn't miss the ability to switch it 
</I>&gt;<i> off. Jan and I still prefer the implementation via protocol because we 
</I>&gt;<i> want to keep it simple and are concerned about the RT latency. I think
</I>&gt;<i> a resonable minimal solution for the time being could be the use of:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 	socket(PF_CAN, SOCK_RAW, CAN_PROTO_NET); /* local loopback */
</I>&gt;<i> 	socket(PF_CAN, SOCK_RAW, CAN_PROTO_DEVICE); /* no loopback */
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>          #define CAN_PROTO_NET 0     (or maybe better CAN_RAW_NET?)
</I>&gt;<i>          #define CAN_PROTO_DEVICE 1  (or maybe bettr CAN_RAW_DEVICE?)
</I>
As pointed out in another posting, a new protocol is simply not the
right way to do it, as it is not a different protocol, but only a
minor change in behavior of an existing protocol.  You send and
receive the same frames, you use the same sockaddr types, etc. the
only difference is where packets are delivered to.  It is a simple
on/off flag to control wether frames are looped back to local
listeners or not, and this is exactly what the {get,set}sockopt calls
where invented for.  There might be further similar flags in the
future which might be reasonable in combination with each other, and
you surely wouldn't want to define 2^n protocols for n such flags.  In
fact, we already have two such flags, one to control looping back in
general, and one to control looping back to the sending socket.  The
two options are

    CAN_RAW_LOOPBACK to enable or disable loopback of packets to the
        sending interface.  The default is on, so that other sockets
        on the same machine will receive everything, that is sent on
        that interface, and not only what is sent from other hosts.

    CAN_RAW_RECV_OWN_MSGS to enable or disable reception of looped
        back packets by the sending socket.  The default is off to
        meet your expectations expressed here.

This means if you simply open a socket and don't use these socket
options you get exactly the behavior you wanted' i.e. you don't see
your own messages.  As long as you open only one socket on the same
host (which I understand is your normal use case) you won't see
anything looped back.  If you do run other sockets connected the same
CAN interface you will soon be happy that packets are looped back.  If
not, switch it off using the socket option.

&gt;<i> The default &quot;0&quot; is what your current implementation does. You have to 
</I>&gt;<i> change nothing. If in the future, there is the need to change the 
</I>&gt;<i> behavior as well, we could still implement an appropriate socket option.
</I>
The result would be what looks like a couple of ideas kludged together
by unkwnoledgeable people having misunderstood the whole point behind
the BSD socket API.  It would look like a an implementation driven
only be current needs without analyzing the whole thing for
similarities to utilize common patterns and the socket API provided
for this.  We would have two different ways (protocol selection and
socket option) to achieve the same thing.

As mentioned above, we already have a solution and AFAICS, it will
meet your needs.  Try it, please.
