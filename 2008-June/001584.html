</I>&gt;<i> Cool!

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Things you should know on this driver:

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Why do you need complex macros?
</I>Mainly debug, to not write the same thing 10 times.
&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i> Please re-test on linux-latest. We try to make things ready for

</I>some day in the very near future.
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> * It won't work on a big endian machine (yet)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Looks like hardware access has to be reviewed.
</I>It _is_ a hardware access. I didn't test it yet, but I know it won't work. I know what to do, but don't know a machine 
to test with.
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> * The drivers looses knowledge of which socket initiated which packet,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 	so CAN_RAW_RECV_OWN_MSGS won't work
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> * status: worked for me,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> uuuuuh...
</I>The CAN_RAW_RECV_OWN_MSGS is something that required a too big effort now. hopefully in the near future.
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> In order to use the pcmcia card, you need firmware.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I didn't hear anything from Softing Gmbh yet, but noticed that the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> firmware in the form of byte-array is released under gpl.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> You can't release byte array firmware under the GPL. The GPL requires
</I>&gt;<i> that the code is in a format which is the &quot;primary&quot; format for editing.
</I>&gt;<i> But the kernel has a standard interface for binary firmware and this
</I>&gt;<i> should be used.
</I>I saw Softing released their code as gpl, with a byte-array to put in the card as firmware. I stripped those off the 
driver,
put them in seperate files, and use the kernel firmware loader.
The main issue I left with, 'May we redistribute?' is, IMHO, covered by them having released their 'hex array's' as gpl.
I don't wish to modify their firmware, but anyone trying to use this, should be able to get the firmware.

PS: Robert, half of the emails are bounced, still too big. I know It's a lot of code, but there was no opportunity to 
use any existing interfaces (I think)
