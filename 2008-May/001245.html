ACK!

I would suggest a function pointer that is set to the common function if 
possible. If we have some strange controller, that needs special 
treatments for the calculating function, the driver (or the driver 
family module - like 'mscan') could carry it's own calculating function 
and point to it in that case.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I wonder where to store the table with the bitrate parameters. If the

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 500&quot; or for the sophisticated user &quot;ifconfig can0 sampling_point 75
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> bittime 1&#181;s&quot;.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     
</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>
ACK! IMHO using ifconfig *just* for up/down is a proper approach.

We should not overload ifconfig with things like bitrates. ifconfig 
mostly sets IP addressing information which we do not have in PF_CAN and 
does never set (ethernet) bitrates ...

All this clock, bitrates, error handling stuff should be strictly 
seperated from ifconfig in sysfs.


&gt;<i> It's too sophisticated, I think. I would like to have two possibilities

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - Non-experts just want to set the bit-rate. From that point it does

</I>&gt;<i>   bit timing parameters.
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>
In general ok but what about strange bitrates like 83333 as used in 
Daimler vehicles? I don't know if we're really getting happy with 
bitrate tables. E.g. i have a hardware on my desk that has 4 
<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/socketcan-core">SJA1000 at 20MHz</A> ... before we fixed the FPGA it was (really bad) 19MHz.

I would suggest just two possibilities to set the bitrate:

- can_bitrate (like 500000) [requires clock]
- can_custom_btregs (hexvalues for specific n btr regs)

I also thought about &quot;- can_custom_bitrate (with tseg &amp; friends) 
[requires clock]&quot; but i don't think, that these (mostly) specific 
calculation functions need to be part of the *kernel* at all. This has 
been confirmed by Uwe and is also my experience. If anyone has the 
request for defined settings this should be calculated by a userspace 
tool which can provide specific btr register values. And these 2,3 or 4 
bytes could be easily pushed into /sys/.../can_custom_btregs .

Oliver
