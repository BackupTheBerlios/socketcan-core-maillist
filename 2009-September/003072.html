</I>
And also for Dave as he stated here:

<A HREF="http://marc.info/?l=linux-netdev&amp;m=125207489710387&amp;w=2">http://marc.info/?l=linux-netdev&amp;m=125207489710387&amp;w=2</A>

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 2. Setup a full can-2.6 git tree with *all* drivers from the SVN
</I>&gt;<i>    repository (excluding the old ones). That's a significant maintenance
</I>&gt;<i>    effort, especially to provide compatibility with older versions.
</I>
IMO it does not make any sense to maintain backward compatible code in a brand
new kernel tree environment ...

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 3. Move the out-of-tree code from the BerliOS SVN repository to git.
</I>&gt;<i>    That's a valuable option, indeed.
</I>
Ack.

For me the current process could be:

* For new drivers (like ems_usb.c):

1. Post source as a diff to net-next-2.6 on SocketCAN Core ML
2. Make some reviews. Still needed changes: goto 1
3. Post source as a diff to net-next-2.6 on netdev ML
4. Make some reviews. Still needed changes: goto 1 or 3
5. Acked-by: Wolfgang
6. Done Mainlining
7. Apply source to out-of-tree-repository
8. Add backward compatibility stuff
9. Done


* For drivers that are only in the out-of-tree-repository:

1. Post patches as a diff to out-of-tree-repository on SocketCAN Core ML
2. Make some reviews. Still needed changes: goto 1
3. Apply to the out-of-tree-repository
4. Done


* For drivers that are in Mainline (and in the out-of-tree-repository):

Post the patches/fixes for the Mainline driver as described in the process for
new drivers.


* To mainline drivers that are currently only in the out-of-tree-repository:

Create a source from the out-of-tree-repository with strip-src and follow the
process for new drivers.


This should make it.

And in most cases the developer can post git-patches based on net-next-2.6
which becomes the leading development repository.

It is no big difference then whether the out-of-tree-repository is a SVN or a
GIT then. I could live with both of them.

Looks the described process sane to all of you?

Regards,
Oliver
