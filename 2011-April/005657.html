I think this means : a wait-queue will not put you asleep while your condition
is true.

My original problem scenario deals with what happens after you woke up.
At the time the state turns ISOTP_IDLE &amp; wake_up_xx(), more than 1 waiter may
be waked.
When the first waked sleeps (for some reason) before setting ISOTP_SENDING,
a second waiter successfully contests so-&gt;tx.state, and falls out the
wait_event_xxx().

At that point, both are waked, and they both think they can use the socket.
That is the point that a locking is necessary.

I solved that with a semaphore (=locking+sleeping). Maybe the problem is
solved by setting ISOTP_SENDING before a possible sleep. I'm not sure that
is a legal solution on SMP. I'm not expert enough on that matter :-).
I just trust the semaphore ...

Anyhow, the return code of wait_event_interruptible should be checked.
Ctrl-C during the wait_event_interruptible will now succeed and start sending,
while the state was _not_ ISOTP_IDLE.
