<PRE>Hi my special friends from the last &quot;Looping back TX messages&quot; 
discussion. O:-)

Last tuesday (the 26th) i was in the University of Magdeburg in a tiny 
workshop and presented the LLCF/socket-can idea and the concepts behind. 
The looping back of TX messages was in agreement to have multiple 
user-applications that can work under identical independent conditions.

But there have been comprehensible concerns about the current 
implementation that is performing the loopback at the same time, when 
the socket-buffer is enqueued into the netdevice TX-queue. This may 
conflict with the following case:

- TX-application is sending CAN-frame with ID 0x777
- CAN-frame 0x777 is enqueued to netdevice and looped back
- a CAN-frame with ID 0x111 is put on the bus by another ECU
- the sending of ID 0x777 is delayed due to ID 0x111 on the bus
- CAN-frame 0x111 is received and routed to RX-application
- CAN-frame 0x777 is finally sent to the bus

The problem is that the RX-application receives the sequence of 
CAN-frames 0x777 and 0x111 /BUT/ on the real bus the order was 0x111 and 
0x777, due to the CSMA/CA principle implemented in the CAN-controller. 
This leads to the problem that a RX-application (like 'candump') would 
receive CAN-frames in a wrong order which is definitely a bad behaviour. :-(

For that reason i would propose to loopback the sent CAN-frame inside 
the CAN-netdevice driver:

static int can_start_xmit(struct sk_buff *skb, struct net_device *dev)
{
	(..) 

	netif_stop_queue(dev);

	//NEW: save skb pointer here

	(..)

	//NEW: no dev_kfree_skb(skb) here


}

static irqreturn_t can_interrupt(int irq, void *dev_id, struct pt_regs *regs)
{
	struct net_device *dev = (struct net_device*)dev_id;
	struct can_priv *priv = netdev_priv(dev);

	(..)

		if (isrc &amp; IRQ_TI) {
			/* transmission complete interrupt */
			priv-&gt;stats.tx_packets++;
			//NEW: netif_rx(my_saved_skb);
			netif_wake_queue(dev);
		}

	(..)
}


This would have the following disadvantages:

D1. This &quot;CAN-behaviour&quot; has to be implemented in every CAN netdevice driver

D2. The can_device struct would need a new element (pointer to tx_skb)

D3. In error cases - that would lead to an error handling with forced 
netif_wake_queue(dev) - the tx_skb has additionally to be removed with 
dev_kfree_skb(my_saved_skb).

D4. In some 'mailbox-designed' CAN controllers there has probably(??) to 
be done something more to loopback the correct tx_skb's on dedicated 
tx-complete-irqs.

This - for some controllers probably increased complexity - was my major 
concern, why we implemented the loopback into the CAN-core in one single 
place in the can_send()-function (see af_can.c) ...

But the advantages for the proposed realization would be:

A1. It is the correct(!) and expected behaviour.

A2. The clone_skb() in can_send() would become obsolete. (less checks, 
more performance, execution time prediction for the CAN-core)

A3. The netif_rx() in can_send() would become obsolete. (it is worth a 
discussion, if the usage of netif_rx() in this layer is 'good style' and 
comprehensible for all kernel maintainers)

A3. The timestamps of  the looped CAN-frames are correct.

A4. In most cases this proposed implementation is not really a 
significant effort to implement.

The proposed implementation would probably also bring the socket-can and 
RT-socket-can concepts/implementations closer together.

I will discuss all this together with Urs tomorrow and on Monday. Please 
send me your comments/concerns/acknowledges for this proposed 
implementation.

Best regards,
Oliver
