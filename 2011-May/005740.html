That software filter is per socket while the hardware filter will be per
device.

</I>
Well, that seems sophisticated resulting in a complex implementation
(may code line) also because hardware filters are very hardware
dependent. Usually just one global filter can be defined. I think that's
overkill. A simple interface using:

  ip link set can0 type can filter &lt;id&gt;:&lt;mask&gt; [&lt;id&gt;:&lt;mask&gt; ...]

would just be fine.
