<PRE>Hi,

there has been an interested discussion started between Pavel Pisa, the
maintainer of LinCAN, and Oliver on the LinCAN forum:

<A HREF="https://sourceforge.net/forum/forum.php?thread_id=1457719&amp;forum_id=170893">https://sourceforge.net/forum/forum.php?thread_id=1457719&amp;forum_id=170893</A>

A private exchange followed which also addressed Wolfgang's recent work
on RT-Socket-CAN. It's now a good chance to refer to his announcement on
xenomai-core: :)

<A HREF="https://mail.gna.org/public/xenomai-core/2006-08/msg00009.html">https://mail.gna.org/public/xenomai-core/2006-08/msg00009.html</A>

From our private thread I would like to pick up some topics and push it
on this list for a broader discussion. Pavel, if you have some
LinCAN-related mailing list to include, please forward/add to CC. Maybe
we could also drag some other aspects from that mentioned forum on the
list(s).

</I>
If I got this correctly, this is based on the read/write stream
interface or LinCAN, right?

Mmm, I wonder if it makes sense to offer such an additional channel for
raw sockets as well. We could allow the user to push a stream of
enhanced raw frames (comparable to rtcan_rb_frame) down for
transmission or to read them directly out of the socket FIFO. I'm just
not sure about a clean API for this. Overload read/write for SOCK_RAW
sockets or using a different socket type (like SOCK_SEQPACKET, but it's
semantic for other protocols is different)?

&gt;<i> I had even plan to separate minor from message objects and allow

</I>&gt;<i> user selects filters. I am not sure, if I would invest time

</I>&gt;<i> But I would like to evaluate these possibilities in our code

</I>
Yeah, this kind of optimisation is imaginable for RT-Socket-CAN as well.
Our FIFO buffer could be allocated only on bind. And if the user passed
some impossible filter (to exploit only device binding for
transmission), the FIFO could be left uncreated.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> on socketcan-core). Having such an interface may further improve the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> performance of data streaming applications like the one I mentioned. Of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> course, any streaming high-level CAN protocols would be trivial to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> address via the socket model (I guess there are some in automotive,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> arent' they, Oliver?)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Beyond this, I wonder how we could join forces. What critical points do

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> you see that our group follows different approaches here as well)?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I do not see advantages in actual LinCAN API. But where I think,
</I>&gt;<i> that our code has potential, is message handling infrastructure.
</I>&gt;<i> Our code has been prepared internally to build queues of different
</I>&gt;<i> priorities on the fly.
</I>&gt;<i> This would allow to connect additional message IDs to already open
</I>&gt;<i> handle for Rx,
</I>
Already feasible with Socket-CAN as well.

&gt;<i> favor priority messages for Rx and Tx.
</I>
My believe is that ordering of incoming messages according to their
priority is better left to the user (attach a high prio thread to a CAN
socket which listens on high prio messages). We allowed such reordering
for a special IPC mechanism due to existing application design, and it
already caused some headache while trying to sort out prio inversions.

Transmission prios are a different story, see below.

&gt;<i> Direct written messages to different queues of the chip according to
</I>&gt;<i> message IDs and their priority.
</I>
This is fairly chip-specific and therefore of limited use for portable
CAN applications. But maybe we can address it when we do so for RX
queues (see below).

&gt;<i> Recompute masks according to Rx filters (implemented).
</I>
The point is that many CAN controllers out there are fairly dumb and
only provide a single hardware mask. Generating that mask automatically
for a typical ID distribution (scattered groups of IDs) doesn't buy you
much. In the end, on RT systems, the system designer is responsible for
setting up a safe global mask that doesn't drag in unacceptable load to
the box.

A different thing is some special (unportable) extension for controllers
that have separate RX queues in hardware. Something like assigning a
socket with all its filters to a specific HW-queue. Definitely a to-do!

&gt;<i> The infrastructure allows to build more complex message delivery meshes.
</I>&gt;<i> For example Hard-RT driver can have RT clients and only one queue to
</I>&gt;<i> non-rt domain, there could be messages redistributed from the hub.
</I>&gt;<i> Another area are redundant networks etc. 
</I>&gt;<i> The SJA1000 chips needs to allow cancellation of lower priority
</I>&gt;<i> message Tx if higher priority Tx is required for RT use.
</I>&gt;<i> Again our queues are prepared for that.
</I>
Yep, thinking about it more in details, I think we may need to have a
look at this prio-inversion issue again. RT-Socket-CAN would
unfortunately require at least a short software TX queue for dealing
with cancellation, Linux Socket-CAN already has stand-alone buffers and
may make use of skb-&gt;priority (or does already?). But can we expect such
TX cancellation feature of any/most controllers?

&gt;<i> And all that through same basic queues code and chip drivers
</I>&gt;<i> callable from RT worker thread or compiled to run in regular Linux IRQs.
</I>&gt;<i> Checked on Linux and RT-Linux/Linux till now. The second case allows
</I>&gt;<i> both RT and non-RT clients for same chip communication object.
</I>
I think RT/non-RT interaction is a non-issue today. If you have strict
RT requirement in your setup, you will pick the RT stack and typically
make use of it for non-RT as well. And the latter is trivial with recent
RT-extensions under Linux: just register your thread at lowest prio with
the RT core (we are even discussing to to this on demand under Xenomai)
and let yourself be switched back and forth when accessing the RT device.

&gt;<i> It would be interesting to discuss, what of these features could
</I>&gt;<i> be mapped to some socket equivalents. I have feeling, that more
</I>&gt;<i> of them could be problematic/hard to implement with reasonable
</I>&gt;<i> overhead. But I can be wrong.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
Your criticism is highly welcome! Throwing our know-how together can
actually help improving all variants and maybe even consolidating them.
I think that the outstanding issues can be resolve in the socket model,
maybe sometimes with varying efficiency, but hopefully always at a high
convenience and abstraction level for the end-user.
