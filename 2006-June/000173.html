<PRE>&gt;<i> &gt; The change of hardware filters has systemwide effects on 
</I>&gt;<i> all applications
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; using this specific CAN-bus (you are currently working on). 
</I>&gt;<i> For this reason
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; changing baudrates and filters is something only root has 
</I>&gt;<i> to do. And root
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; should do this on startup, BEFORE all applications begin 
</I>&gt;<i> with their work. So
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; if root decides to change hardware-filters on the fly, the 
</I>&gt;<i> user-applications
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; may loose some frames. But: What happens if your 
</I>&gt;<i> application needs CAN-IDs
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; root is just masking out?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Is changing hardware-filters on the fly a real use-case?
</I>&gt;<i> If it will be part of socket filters (i.e. use hwd. filters 
</I>&gt;<i> while it is
</I>&gt;<i> not full, then switch to a software one) then yes, such terrible
</I>&gt;<i> situation occurred very often.
</I>&gt;<i> BUT I have some another idea: How about &quot;virtual&quot; (or aliased) CAN
</I>&gt;<i> devices? I.e. for each hwd. filter (or, in other words, 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;mailbox&quot;) what
</I>&gt;<i> we have, we could create something like can0:1, can0:2, can0:N devices
</I>&gt;<i> in startup scripts. This behavior certainly resurrect &quot;CANbus-address&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> concept (as minimum of 3 types: 32bits, 16bits, 8bits),
</I>&gt;<i> but I don't think that it will be big problem.
</I>&gt;<i> Workflow  in this case will be next:
</I>&gt;<i>   &quot;ifconfig can0 CANADDR CANMASK&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>   &quot;ifconfig can0:1 CANADDR CANMASK&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>    ......
</I>&gt;<i>   &quot;ifconfig can0 up&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>   &quot;ifconfig can0:1 up&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>    ....
</I>&gt;<i> where CANADDR/CANMASK is a ACR/AMR values correspondingly.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So disabling changing/addition new filters on the fly, i.e.
</I>&gt;<i> if one of canX:N is in ACTIVE state, will be natural and logical.
</I>
The socket-can core does a good job - even in performant filtering. We run
it successfully in 133MHz PPC405-boxes with 4 SJA1000 CAN-busses under heavy
load. When you are filtering on single SFF-IDs the filtering is done in one
step. I was just thinking about a SFF-softwarefilter which can be handled in
the CAN-drivers interrupt context. But nevertheless all this might not be
enough to reduce the interrupt load on really weak systems.
But with all our improvements, we should look that we don't break up with
the original idea to implement CAN-drivers as network-devices. So maybe it
is an idea to have ONE CAN-network-driver that creates as many netdevices as
it has mailboxes at start-time. And these netdevices are named can0:0,
can0:1, etc.
What do you think?
 
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 2) PHY.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;   if(can-&gt;phy)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt; where the transceivers are controlled correctly by 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; hardwaredependend 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt; GPIO-pins.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; For a GPIO based devices exist platform data/platform drivers 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; (check i2c/spi/rtc drivers).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt; I assume we will become mad, when we try to cover any f*cking 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt; (transceiver)hardware derivate with one driver and one 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt; ioctl()-interface.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; No, I think that each (family of) transceiver(s)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; must have itself driver.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The idea looks nice but where is the code for the 
</I>&gt;<i> transceiver hosted? In an
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; extra kernel-module? 
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, this should be proffered way. But since transceiver is a
</I>&gt;<i> board/platform specific device, it may be placed in corresponding
</I>&gt;<i> board/platform driver.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;And this kernel-module is hardware-specific then?
</I>&gt;<i> Yes.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; How can you link the can-controller and the associated 
</I>&gt;<i> transceiver and the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; different hardware-adresses?
</I>&gt;<i> By name of transceiver, but problem of enumeration may be arising.
</I>&gt;<i> So this conception need more examination.
</I>
Yep - this looks like a real problem.
What about giving the transceiver-driver some kind of command-line
parameters that can be identified by the real CAN-driver? E.g. give the
transceiver the information to which CAN-controller it is connected, by the
baseaddress of the CAN-controller. So the CAN-controller can ask the
transceiver-driver with his baseadress and gets a link to the transceiver.
This may fit into most hardware-realisations that need to work with
transceivers.
