We had a deep discussion about naming conventions on can.[k]o.
The can.ko comes from af_can.c and proc.c where the statistics and states of

the PF_CAN-core can be found.

According to other implementations (Urs please help me here) we decided to 
name the CAN-core 'can' and the CAN-protocols can-xxx (e.g. can-bcm, 
can-raw, etc.).

YOU may wish to get even CAN-driver related stuff when loading the 
network-layer CAN-core. I definetely WON'T! It's no good way to mix up 
network-layer and netdevice-layer things only because we have to load only 
ONE module. It remains wrong, however you like to find arguments, sorry.

So can.ko, can-xxx.ko is for the CAN-core with all the network-layer 
functionality, that's needed. And it is good like this.

Feel free to introduce new ideas on the netdevices in drivers/net/can but 
not to mix things up, that do not belong together.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Meanwhile both drivers (af_can and can_device) must be loaded
</I>&gt;<i> to provide basic can functionality.
</I>
correctly: can.ko for network-layer
And if you like can_device.ko for CAN-driver helper functions.

&gt;<i> So, follow to Occam's razor
</I>&gt;<i> principle, this drivers should be combined into one
</I>&gt;<i> (as minimum for a lower memory consumption).
</I>
No. There is not really a significant higher memory consumption that may 
give a reason to glue these different things together. Having a 
can_device.ko looks like a reasonable idea. But putting everything that has 
'something' to do with CAN into one module is against good taste. Please 
search for similar things in the kernel - i think, you won't find a mix up 
between network-layer and netdevice-layer like you want to introduce here
...

I started the LLCF to make things right.

Regards,

Oliver
