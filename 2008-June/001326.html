</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> and was once implemented by a patch from Juergen.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>   
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> There had been many reasons for this:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 1. It turned out to be a very complex topic for different controllers 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> with specific originalities and specific (broken) clock sources.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> True.
</I>
And so far we failed to provide an algorithm for calculating &quot;good&quot;
btregs. Be aware that most of us are not CAN hardware experts.

&gt;&gt;<i> 2. There is no reason good to put bitrate specialized calculations into 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> kernel source (and maybe different algos for different controllers and 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> different user opinions).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I disagree. &quot;bitrate&quot; is an important property of every CAN driver, and
</I>&gt;<i> knowing how to set it properly is definetly the drivers task. Maybe its
</I>&gt;<i> most important task, as the rest is quite trivial.
</I>
Yes and the user can still set default btregs (CIA recommended if
possible) by just selecting the bitrate. The driver must provide an
appropriate table of btregs for the common bitrates. For most CAN
controllers, this is easy to do.

&gt;&gt;<i> I want to beware all of us to have these algo discussions on netdev-ML. 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> And things that could be handled easily with a userspace tool should 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> definitely reside in the userspace.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I agree, but only in a hardware-independent way. Calculating register
</I>&gt;<i> values in userspace is a no-go. From a userspace app we want to open a
</I>&gt;<i> socket and configure the bitrate without having to care about what chip
</I>&gt;<i> is behind it. If that were not possible, we would lose much of the
</I>&gt;<i> advantages of having PF_CAN in the networking core.
</I>
See above. The direct btregs setting will be for experts only.

&gt;&gt;<i> So all the specialists out there can 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> have fun with their specific homebrew and tuned bitrate algos.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, but only with hardware independent attributes like the ones listed
</I>&gt;<i> above.
</I>
But with that hardware independent way,we may fail calculating &quot;good&quot;
values for all CAN controller and clock frequencies.

&gt;&gt;<i> Btw. we decided to implement a 'non-expert' bitrate calculation for 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> non-expert users. But not all the prop_seg stuff ...
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> So you just have
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> [1] simple bitrate calculation (maybe overruled by bitrate tables that 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> are compiled-in or set at runtime)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> [2] btreg settings (for specialists)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> What do I do in at91_can? I don't have btr0 or btr1. Do you really want
</I>&gt;<i> to export chip specific registers through sysfs? Then we will see loads
</I>&gt;<i> of userspace programs that only work with certain chips (similar to good
</I>&gt;<i> old DOS times when printer drivers were compiled into the application).
</I>
You have four bytes for btr setting. Should be enough for the AT91 as
well. As said, the built-in table of bt-regs should provide proper
default bt-regs for the normal user.

&gt;<i> We could avoid that problem by putting bitrate calculation stuff into a
</I>&gt;<i> userspace library, but then this lib has to be maintained to be in sync
</I>&gt;<i> with kernel development, and we run into kernel vs. library version problems.
</I>
There is not so much sync needed, just the API on how to get the CAN
controller type and how to set the btreg. Such a library may help both,
users and experts to determine special btregs.

&gt;<i> I vote for doing this in the driver and keep the interface to userspace
</I>&gt;<i> completely hardware independent.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> It would be nice if you could just go to the appropriate discussion in 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the mailinglist archive.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I didn't ;-) I missed parts of that discussion at the time, sorry if I
</I>&gt;<i> repeated stuff that was already discussed.
</I>
OK, it's still a RFC. It would be nice to hear some opinions from people
(companies) working in the CAN bus business.

Wolfgang.
