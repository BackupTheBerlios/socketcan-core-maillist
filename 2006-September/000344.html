<PRE>In af_can.c we have a list of structs containing list heads for each
can device on which a socket has registered using can_rx_register().
When registering with a device we scan the list for the appropriate
entry in the list and insert it if it's not present.  Since we modify
the list we hold a spinlock for this operation.  OTOH, if we need to
insert a new entry we need to call kmalloc() which is disallowed while
holding a lock.  We currently have something like

        spin_lock(&amp;lock);
        list_for_each(d, &amp;list_head, ...) {
                if (d-&gt;dev == dev)
                        break;
        if (!d) {
                d = kmalloc(sizeof(*d), GFP_KERNEL);
                list_add(d, &amp;list_head)
        }
        /* do some thing with d */
        ;
        spin_unlock(&amp;lock);

which is buggy because of the kmalloc() while holding the lock.  I
haven't found any alternative that completely satisfies me.  I have
thought abount the following:

1. Do the kmalloc() before acquiring the lock and free the memory if
   we find the entry already existing in the list.  This means that in
   most cases we do a needless and possibly expensive kmalloc()
   followed quickly by kfree().

2. Use GFP_ATOMIC instead of GFP_KERNEL, which leads to somewhat
   higher probability that the kmalloc() fails.

3. Use GFP_ATOMIC instead of GFP_KERNEL, and if the kmalloc() fails do
   kmalloc(GFP_KERNEL) after releasing the lock, then go back, scan
   the list again and free the memory if in the meantime (while we
   didn't hold the lock) someone else already has inserted the list
   item in question.  This looks somewhat ugly, IMO.

4. Abandon the list completely and put the struct dev_rcv_lists into
   struct can_device, thus eliminating the need for dynamically
   allocated memory for this struct and for scanning the list to find
   the required device.  But that means that all CAN interface
   implementations *have* to use the struct can_device in the priv
   pointer and that bind(2) on a PF_CAN socket has to ensure that the
   specified device is indeed a CAN device which has a associated
   struct can_device.  This could probably best be done by checking it
   has ARPHDR_CAN of the device.  The bad smell of this solution is
   that the priv data of a netdevice become not so private anymore
   (which we already have anyway since we use the priv pointer to
   point to struct can_device to hold common data for CAN interfaces).

Other suggestions?
