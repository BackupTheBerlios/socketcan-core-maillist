</I>1. during this discussion, I learned that combining source &amp; destination
   in 1 sockaddr is bad. I turned my code into a seperate source &amp;
   destination, with only PGN duplicated. It avoids some other confusion,
   like which fields are used/filled out in: bind(), connect(),
   recvfrom(), sendto()
2. To know the exact destination address of an incoming message, I added
   a sockopt to add the original destination sockaddr into a cmsg.
   so, a recvfrom(), you must suppose you're a receiver, but don't know
   if it were a broadcast or not. with recvmsg(), you can find out.
3. Since priority is an option, I turned that into a sockopt
   (potentially reusing the existing SO_PRIORITY option). for receiving,
   the priority is only usefull in debugging, and I put it into a cmsg
   entry in recvmsg().
(1), (2) &amp; (3) lead to
   struct {
      uint8_t addr;
      uint32_t pgn;
   } j1939;
which is very clean.
I know most j1939 users will ask where the DA has gone, but existing
socket API's have different structs for source &amp; destination.

To come to this stripped version, a few cmsg entries are added to allow
debugging tools get all information, but those entries are IMO not used
in everyday communication.
Some socketoptions will be used in everyday applications, but that does
not make the code (using a j1939 socket) much more complex.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> and
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>       uint64_t name;

</I>would 
struct sockaddr_can {
   union {
      struct {
         uint8_t addr;
         uint32_t pgn;
      } j1939;
      struct {
         uint8_t addr;
         uint32_t pgn;
         uint64_t name;
      } j1939_dyn;
   } can_addr;
};
make things better then? IMO not.

when the 8byte name is added to the sockaddr, like 
   struct {
      uint64_t name;
      uint8_t addr;
      uint32_t pgn;
   } j1939;
   I doubt there would be confusion.
   leaving the name empty (0) would ignore dynamic addressing, having the name
   non-empty would disable the addr (for transmissions).
   For receiving, the name would be filled out when available, the addr
   would be filled out always.

The possible misusage I can imagine is that the name is set to something
(non-empty) when a statis SA was meant, so an error would probably
occur indicating the 8byte name is not known in the system.
It's like stuffing a sockaddr_in with random values. You won't get the
result you expected, but the stack (in the j1939 case) is able to report clean errors.
This latter is IMHO a crucial part of a good API, since people make
mistakes anywhere.
If name is required to be 0, that not a real obstacle, IMO. having the
addr defaulting to 0xff is more obstacle.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I would suggest to have the shown j1939 struct in sockaddr_can to handle the

</I>IMO, my replacement (without da &amp; priority) matches better the original socket API
in the way that source &amp; destination are seperated ...
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> By setting the uint64_t name with a socketoption the behaviour of the selected

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> - the source address (sa) is set dynamically depending on the name
</I>When this 8byte name is stripped from the sockaddr,
this would work as sender (definitely), but would not work as good for receiving.
An extra cmsg would work, but I doubt such API (for standard
usage) is a good API.
When one would move from static to dynamic addressing,  that means one is forced
to use recvmsg() over recv() &amp; recvfrom(), which looks to me as a way too big constraint
(read: being forced is a big constraint).
given the small step you're taking. IMO, this proves the API being rude
to users of dynamic addressed busses.

&gt;<i> - the sockets data structures are updated according the dynamic addressing
</I>&gt;<i> - any other things that differ when using the J1939 name
</I>Filtering on a dynamic bus, would not base on SA, but
on 8byte name. As such, the 8byte name is used all over the API _but_
the sockaddr, which sounds strange to me.
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Would this work for you?
</I>I'm glad you started the discussion on the API, you made me clean it up.
Now I've come the the smallest version (still bigger that current
      sockaddr_can).

I do understand that my proposition extends the original sockaddr_can.
This would not be the first time it changes.
My original patch (starting this thread) solves the problems related with extending it.

Up to now, I've only had some well crafted C programs.
Some time in the future, I would have some reallife j1939 (dynamically
      addressed) example, or a Documentation/j1939.txt, to demonstrate
the API, and the need to have the 8byte name in sockaddr_can.
