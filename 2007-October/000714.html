</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Ah! - You have different 'phases' here, which may tell us, that you do 
</I>&gt;<i> not run in single-shot mode and normal operation mode at the same time 
</I>&gt;<i> on the wire :-)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> To shortly summarize my investigations, it looks like ...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1. the single-shot mode is not provided by every CAN controller
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 2. only the SJA1000 can switch between single-shot and normal operation 
</I>&gt;<i> on a frame base
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 3. TTCAN compatible controllers (like AT89C51CC02) have a dedicated 
</I>&gt;<i> TTCAN mode that enables single-shot (only here!)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In TTCAN you have to run single-shot even in the &quot;Arbitrating Time 
</I>&gt;<i> Window&quot; so that the timing window remains guaranteed for the other 
</I>&gt;<i> (fixed) time windows. Finally from what i've read and discussed with 
</I>&gt;<i> experienced colleagues i would summarize that having single-shot frames 
</I>&gt;<i> and normal operation frames on the wire at the same time is not a valid 
</I>&gt;<i> use-case. For that reason i would tend to put the controlling of this 
</I>&gt;<i> medium access configuration into the driver and not to provide a user 
</I>&gt;<i> interface which may lead to an inconsistent node behaviour when 
</I>&gt;<i> generating a mix of different CAN frames transfer modes in a single 
</I>&gt;<i> context/mode/phase. This was just a gud feeling before but after reading 
</I>&gt;<i> all that documentation, i'm quite sure that single-shot or normal 
</I>&gt;<i> operation needs to be a bus-wide consistent setting for a given use-case.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> At the level of code which is dispatching the CAN
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> frames it seems wrong to have awareness of what phase of usage the bus
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> is in (address claim or normal transfers) - rather we are just told to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> send the packet single shot or not single shot by the layer above.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> As you wrote you can split up the communication in an 'address claim 
</I>&gt;<i> phase' and a 'normal bus transfer' phase. For that reason, i would _not_ 
</I>&gt;<i> assume these phases to toggle rapidly (at least i assume them to switch 
</I>&gt;<i> one time: on and off). To solve this problem, you just could check in 
</I>&gt;<i> which mode the CAN-frame has to be sent and to switch the appropriate 
</I>&gt;<i> mode in the CAN-controller, if it's not already in that mode. This 
</I>&gt;<i> should be necessary only two times in the address claim phase then.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Any concerns left?
</I>
No, I checked the MPC2515 manual and there &quot;Single-Shot&quot; is a mode of 
operation like listen-only and therefore it makes little sense to handle 
it on per transfer base because it must be set in configuration mode.

Wolfgang.
