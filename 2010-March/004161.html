The optional point is the choice between the 2 members, but in both
cases will the other one be discarded.
I agree to avoid overloading (stripped a lot yet), but I don't consider
j1939.name as optional. it is required in at least 80% of my use.

Although j1939 _was_ primary used
with static addressing, most busses I encounter now are mixed, and dynaddr
seems to increase (in my world at least).

Maybe I'll describe the dynaddr in j1939 a bit by comparing with DHCP.
DHCP is host based, ie. it concerns a single host (and a server). During
the DHCP, the host is unreachable (no IP yet). After DHCP, the host has
a 'fixed' IP. If the host would start a new DHCP request, it may get
another IP (theoretically). From that point in time, the old IP is
not assigned to that host. Any IP connections will get stalled,
since DHCP was not a network or bus operation.
dynamic addressing in j1939 differs on 1 important issue, in a way that address
claiming is a bus operation. This allows/forces other members on the bus
to update their name-address caches.
Any j1939 member should still keep functioning, with the updated
address in mind, ie. if I was listening to SA 0x80, which moved to 0x81,
I'm supposed to transparently continue listening to 0x81.

In theory, even a pending transport protocol session should move to the
new SA (0x81), although I _suspect_ most implementations will just abort &amp;
retry.

This can only be done by effectively do the listening based on 64bit
name, and not the 8bit address. It would create a mess in a program.

Therefore, my proposal is to ignore the SA completely at that point,
and work with the name instead.

&gt;<i> that need to be checked if != 0. Better send a cmsg entry with the name when
</I>I tend to evaluate static &amp; dynamic addressing as equal choices.
Requiring cmsg in case of dynamic addressing, makes this choice
'unequal', not _as_ straightforward.
So, we (the API) lead the user into preferring static addressing.
To illustrate this with the use-cases I provided,
then '2' does require _other_ calls in order to make it dynaddr-capable
than '3' &amp; '4' do.
&gt;<i> it needs to be.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Would you be also fine with that in the case of dynamic addressing?
</I>Although there's no technical problem left,
I hesitate to make that choice to the API.

If it's ok, I'd like move away from pure technical issues, and inspect
the API as such. see also the difference with DHCP above.
Since I didn't convince my management of open-sourcing all yet, there's
no hurry anyway.

IMHO, your proposal violates these 2 major points you mentioned earlier
with API design (with special regard to dynamic addressing, since static
addressing will does not suffer this):
* Easy to learn
* Easy to use, even without documentation.

I think I would prefer documenting that 'name == 0 means static
addressing used'.
We coud so reduce the application choice between static &amp;
dynamic addressing to just choosing between j1939.name &amp; j1939.addr, rather
than choosing between API calls.
Yes, this choice can be made wrong. When j1939.name is set, but not
used, users might experience problems. I bet this will occur much
sooner if they would need to get the name elsewhere (via cmsg()).

The biggest challenge with documenting this j1939 approach IMO is learn
typical CAN/J1939 users to think in terms of local &amp; remote addresses in
a BSD socket compliant way, rather than combining local &amp; remote address
in 1 can_id (as I also did when I started 10 years ago, I'm not blaming
anyone here).
The dynamic thing is minor challenge in documenting the api, given that
using it is not too difficult.
