AFAIK Urs used quilt for the mainline patches. When ever we had any 
changes i updated the SVN in parallel. Currently i personally work on 
the SVN for tests and fixes. When there are any changes for the mainline 
kernel, i use the strip-src script and put the changed source into my 
local net-2.6 git tree to create a git diff for posting to David Miller 
and on netdev-ML.

This works fine for me and also holds the SVN up-to-date (even for older 
kernels).

But i don't have any objections to change this process for the CAN 
netdrivers. The drivers should go via Jeff Garziks personal netdev-2.6 
git into net-2.6 and finally into linux-2.6.

Using git will kick us always to the head of the mainline development. 
My suggestion would be to make the current development and driver API 
settlement in the SVN and then create a can-2.6 git for the drivers that 
are ready for upstream - this makes it easy for Jeff to pull our work 
into his tree.

And if we should keep the SVN source of mainlined drivers up-to-date is 
a question that can be discussed with the different driver maintainers 
afterwards ...

Regards,
Oliver
