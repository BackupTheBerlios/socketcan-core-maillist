<PRE>Hi!

I've just ported some test programs to Berlios Socketcan, one program is 
can_sequence.

It opens a PF_CAN socket and sends packets (with increasing packet 
numbers inside) as fast as it can. After a few seconds a write fails 
with an errno of ENOBUFS &quot;No buffer space available&quot;. What the userspace 
does is to generate packages faster than they could be delivered.

We at pengutronix think this is an inappropriate behaviour. From 
connection orriented protocols (yes I know, CAN is different) like 
TCP/IP I get an EWOULDBLOCK/EAGAIN if the sender runs out of buffers or 
it comes to congestions in the &quot;connection&quot;.

I would appreciate that CAN behaves in a similar manner. A propper 
solution would also include the possibility to select/poll on a 
&quot;congested&quot; socket till it is free again.

I've looked through the code a bit and AFAICS the ENOBUFS comes from here:

a) net/can/raw.c:raw_sendmsg()
    allocs a skb with skb_alloc() and calls finally can_send()

b) net/can/af_can.c:can_send()
    calls dev_queue_xmit()

c) net/core/dev.c:dev_queue_xmit()
    tries to add skb to the device's queue
    returns a &quot;NET_XMIT_DROP&quot; when the txqueue of the device is full
    (the skb is really lost in that case)

d) net/can/af_can.c:can_send()
    converts NET_XMIT_DROP to -ENOBUFS

e) -ENOBUFS is finally returned into userspace


In order to work around this problem we have added rather hackish patch 
to our BSP. It consists of two parts:

1) In the write/sendmsg codepath: net/can/raw.c:raw_sendmsg(), replace
    the allocation of the skb &quot;alloc_skb()&quot; with &quot;sock_alloc_send_skb()&quot;
    (see attached patch)

2) set the txqueuelen of a can device to 10000
    (via ifconfig during runtime)

This brings the following changes:
- The skb's memory comes from the socket
- The sockets memory buffer will run empty if the packets can't be
   transmitted and thus freed
- sock_alloc_send_skb() will block in this case
   (maybe even return EGAIN/EWOULDBLOCK in case of a nonblocking socket,
    but I havn't tested that)
- last but not least, if only one socket is involed, the sockets memory
   pool runs out _before_ the txqueue of then device runs over
   But you have a per socket memory pool, which means that the more
   sockets you have, the more skb have to be queued before the memory is
   out. So we can calculate when then txqueuelen of 10000 isn't long
   enough.

As I said before, this is rather hackish. I prefer a clean solution.
Waiting for you comments.

Please don't say: &quot;CAN is an unreliable protocol anyway, so it doesn't 
matter if the packages are dropped in the kernel.&quot;

How does rtcan handle this problem?

regards - Marc
