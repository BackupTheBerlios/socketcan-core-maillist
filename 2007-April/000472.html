<PRE>Hello all,

we have decided to give try to the SocketCAN on the
BOA5200 board
  <A HREF="http://dce.felk.cvut.cz/nms/?p=hardware#boa5200">http://dce.felk.cvut.cz/nms/?p=hardware#boa5200</A>

We have managed to make it work, but there are some
minor issues. We have started from the SocketCAN
SVN trunk code taken about moth ago. May it be, that
something has already been solved or that there
is more actual version for MSCAN somewhere else.

Our actual patch series for 2.6.18 kernel can be taken from
  <A HREF="http://rtime.felk.cvut.cz/repos/boa5200-linux/">http://rtime.felk.cvut.cz/repos/boa5200-linux/</A>
or can be accessed as Darcs repository
  <A HREF="http://rtime.felk.cvut.cz/darcs/darcsweb.cgi?r=boa5200-linux">http://rtime.felk.cvut.cz/darcs/darcsweb.cgi?r=boa5200-linux</A>

 - linux-2.6.18-1_AM-ws.diff
      the A&amp;M kindly provided BOA5200 board patches

      The diff between Vanilla 2.6.18 and official A&amp;M
      BOA5200 kernel tree. The whitespace, indentation
      unintentional changes and garbage removed to keep patch
      at reasonable size. 
 - socketcan-core.patch
      unmodified SocketCAN core part
 - socketcan-drivers.patch
      driver related SocketCAN code
 - socketcan-glue.patch
      glue to integrate SocketCAN into kernel build
 - socketcan-fixes.patch
      some minor corrections in the socketcan and MSCAN sources.
      Included GPL license to allow module loading, correction
      of the header file and source file names. Object file cannot have
      same name as the linked module if module is composed of more files,
      else Kbuild is unhappy.
 - socketcan-mpc52xx-clock.patch
      there is problem, that most boards included in the vanilla kernel
      provides mscan platform device resources, but do not provide clock
      information as platform_data. We have decided to allow MSCAN code
      to select XTAL base (suggested by manual anyway) automatically
      for such case. The clock is hardcoded to 33MHz in this patch.
      This is not nice, but I have not found any function or definition
      in PPC kernel providing information about chip reference clock
      oscillator frequency. It is shame and should be solved better
      way.
 - socketcan-baudrate-in-sys.patch
      We have problem to select baudrate of the interface. There is no module
      parameter and I have not found the tool sources or some clean reference
      to this in the manual. This patch adds ability to read and control
      baudrate over SYS filesystem
         cat /sys/class/net/can0/can_baudrate
         echo 660000 &gt;/sys/class/net/can0/can_baudrate
         ifconfig can0 up
      It would be nice to include this solution into SocketCAN generally.
      The best way would be to add this support into SocketCAN core,
      but it would need to replace
            ret = register_netdev(CAN2ND(can));
      in the chip drivers by
            ret = register_candev(can);
      and provide register_candev() by core same way as alloc_candev()
      is provided. Advantage - API would be more consistent then.

      Actual code adds this sys baudrate attribute only to the MSCAN
      driver code.

We have still problem with baudrate configuration.

Even, that we are sure, that 33MHz oscillator is used,
the computation gives incorrectly scaled results.
We have to select 660000 Baud to achieve 1 MBaud in result.
Is there some corrected version of the code or is mistake on our side?

May it be, that the code computing time segments should have
some definition of the actual chip capabilities as additional input.
The allowed ranges of the TSEG1, TSEG2, prescaller etc. Else code
cannot be used in generic manner for all chips

The example of such code can be found in or code at
<A HREF="http://rtime.felk.cvut.cz/darcs/darcsweb.cgi?r=students/mareks1-canfestival;a=headblob;f=/libs4c/canfestival/driver/canOpenDriver.c#l304">http://rtime.felk.cvut.cz/darcs/darcsweb.cgi?r=students/mareks1-canfestival;a=headblob;f=/libs4c/canfestival/driver/canOpenDriver.c#l304</A>

The function
  int can_auto_baud(long baud_rate, int *pbrp, int *ptseg1, int *ptseg2, int sampl_pt, can_calc_const_t *c)
and structure
  typedef struct {
    int sync;
    int tseg1_min;
    int tseg1_max;
    int tseg2_min;
    int tseg2_max;
    int brp_min;
    int brp_max;
    int brp_inc;
    int fix_div;
  } can_calc_const_t;

I have not inlined all material into this e-mail,because it would
make it too big. All code can be taken from our Web or repositories.
If there would be discussion about some specific parts, I would include
code to comments in followup e-mails.

Thanks for any suggestions or comments in advance
