There are no properties other than the required properties.  The others
were wrongly introduced and are not needed by the driver.  When we
removed the other properties and the wrong documentation of the mscan
oscillator source in the fsl-flexcan.txt file, we were left with an
Example: section and a one-line statement &quot;The only properties supported
are the required properties.&quot;  That seemed like the fsl-flexcan.txt
file was then pointless.

Ok.  I can do that too.  Who is the definitive source for that answer?
I assume we are talking about the fsl-flexcan.txt file when we say
binding.  Is that correct?

For the answer to that, you will need to ask Wolfgang Grandegger.  I was
working from his feedback.  Looking at the plethora of other node names,
the vast majority do not have any -v#.#, and the ones that do also tend
to have multiple versions. Based upon that, I suspect he is correct,
but I do not know where the documentation is or if it even exists.

Thanks,
Robin
