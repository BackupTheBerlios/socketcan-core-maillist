<PRE>Hi Pavel,

now i want to try to answer your first mail ...

&gt;<i> Hello Oliver,

Good idea. Most guys do not go that deep before making own comments :-(

&gt;<i> I want to congratulate you for very well defined API.
</I>
Tnx! As i stated in the other Posting from 2006-08-09 it was the plan to
have a well defined &amp; easy to use Socket-API that combines CAN &amp; Socket
flavour together.

&gt;<i> To my surprise, the reuse of Linux kernel SKB layer provides significantly
</I>&gt;<i> higher CAN implementation complexity reduction than I have
</I>&gt;<i> originally expected. Not that complexity is not there, it is hidden in SKB
</I>&gt;<i> handling, but it reuses infrastructure that is on the apex of interest of
</I>&gt;<i> kernel architects, so its implementation is well optimized. The overhead
</I>&gt;<i> for exceptionally short CAN messages should be checked.
</I>
We're just dealing with the struct can_frame (16 Bytes) all the time, and i
think the only 'expensive' thing is to create the SKB. From there it's zero
copying inside the Kernel. The LLCF (the VW project name) is running on 130
MHz Tricore and on many other platforms (<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/socketcan-core">PPC405 at 133MHz</A>, x86,
XScale-Zaurus-PDA) with a very good performance better than we expected.

&gt;<i> I like your balance of delivery queues categorisation in &quot;struct
</I>rcv_dev_list&quot;
&gt;<i> which is probably one of the little functional and reasonably optimal
</I>solutions
&gt;<i> for masked ID based filtering.
</I>
Yes this is my favorite part. Urs had only one single linked list at the
beginning, as he didn't want to make 'complex' solutions until we are going
into performance problems. From my side i was working in deeply embedded
systems for years any for this reason, i am always thinking in saving
CPU-performance &amp; Memory.

&gt;<i> Yes EFF complicates things.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
I was thinking on some kind of hash-table here, if one really works
intensive on single EFF-Frame-IDs.

&gt;<i> There is extreme need to unify CAN interfaces for Linux kernel and get
</I>&gt;<i> it into mainline kernel and I confirm that your solution is the most
</I>promising
&gt;<i> candidate.
</I>
Yes, that was my intention (next to learning how to integrate the CAN-world
into 'real' OSs and to wake up the 'automotive IT-engineers' :-)

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I have tried to start discussion about Linux CAN unification process
</I>&gt;<i> for many years. But I have not much luck there and responses (counting
</I>socket
&gt;<i> CAN advocates), even that I have invested non-marginal amount of my time
</I>&gt;<i> (often unbackuped even by our university) to Linux CAN support for many
</I>users
&gt;<i> for free. The lack of the will to communicate is probably due significant
</I>&gt;<i> political and economical dark OSS players who damage state of art progress
</I>&gt;<i> in favour of temporarily advantages and gains which behavior has already
</I>lead
&gt;<i> to vanishing of their previously so glorified proprietary systems in last

</I>&gt;<i> The TIXP4xx networking code is one of examples how to make many people to

&gt;<i> time and money for crappy code for undocumented hardware. There are many
</I>other
&gt;<i> similar BSPs holding people on 2.4.18 kernel forks and other obfuscated
</I>ill
&gt;<i> licensed code.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I hope that your intention is to play fair in this respect, because else
</I>&gt;<i> it could give you short time gain but it would contribute to blocking
</I>Linux
&gt;<i> to be sandbox place for enthusiasts, who has made Linux, what it is now.
</I>&gt;<i> I would like to believe, that my very frustrating and almost year progress
</I>&gt;<i> (in non CAN area) damaging experience with one of members seen on
</I>&gt;<i> your project page was only exceptional and temporarily blackout of his
</I>&gt;<i> ability evaluate technical argument in favour of some plotting plans
</I>&gt;<i> and self-conceit. Nobody is perfect and I know that well about myself.
</I>
My frustration is more on limited resources (e.g. Urs is often blocked with
other issues and set's (IMO) wrong priorities to push the socket-can topic).
I have a quite clear imagination on what socket-can should be but i like the
system-design-discussion with Urs (and his Kernel-experience) and all the
others which are currently on the mailing list.
And at the end there are these RT-Hackers like Jan and you, who always have
tricky but interesting requirements ;-)

I hope we can create an 'nice' solution bringing all our needs under one hat
(== in balance)!

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Now back to your code. I think, that it is shame that you have not
</I>&gt;<i> tried to answer to my previously stated questions. Your code addresses
</I>&gt;<i> many of them, some can be evaluated as superfluous. Even if some
</I>&gt;<i> limitations cannot be addressed at all, this does not mean,
</I>&gt;<i> that socket based solution cannot be considered as most appropriate.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> There are some areas in your code, which I think that intention
</I>&gt;<i> should to be paid for.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The first, I agree, that your raw CAN message format is well aligned
</I>&gt;<i> but I am not sure, if there should not be some field for
</I>&gt;<i> communication object index on full CAN controllers.
</I>
Is this really that important to know the communication object index? Don't
you get enough information regarding the received CAN-ID? At what point is
it worthy to use the communication object index as differentiator?

I have been thinking on creating _several_ 'virtual' network-devices, that
represent one or more communication object indices of _ONE_ real
CAN-Hardware. I don't know if it is that good IT-flavour to bring
Controller-specific-things like Mailboxes up to the user in that way that
you put information in every 'enhanced CAN-Frame' you pass through the
Kernel - even when nobody else needs it or the used hardware does not
support it.

&gt;<i> The obtaining of timestamps seems to have significant overhead.
</I>&gt;<i> I am not sure for latest kernels, but IOCTL was known as requiring BKL
</I>&gt;<i> even on relatively recent 2.6 kernels.
</I>
As Jan stated in his Posting today &quot;You don't need an IOCTL to obtain
timestamps with Socket-CAN. They can
also come via msg.msg_control.&quot;

But for me it is really an consideration to enable some kind of 'enhanced'
data structure containing an 64bit timestamp and an interface-index. For the
RX-path this should be easy to implement with the existing RAW-Socket and
some new socket-option.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The next code seems to me to have unnecessarily higher algorithmic
</I>&gt;<i> complexity too.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> af_can.c:530 int can_rcv()
</I>&gt;<i>        /* find receive list for this device */
</I>&gt;<i>         for (q = rx_dev_list; q; q = q-&gt;next)
</I>&gt;<i>                 if (q-&gt;dev == dev)
</I>&gt;<i>                         break;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> There should be some direct mapping between
</I>&gt;<i> net_device and rcv_dev_list. I understand, that there could be
</I>&gt;<i> problem with locking and space in generic networking structure,
</I>&gt;<i> but it is not excuse for not thinking about that a little more.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
AFAIK you don't have per-device-queues for netdevices in the
kernel-networklayer. A netdevice puts a SKB with a ETH_P_XXXXX-frame into
the networklayer using the netif_rx(skb)-call and then the network-protocol
that registered for ETH_P_XXXXX-frames gets this SKB. 

As i wanted the comparisons in the receive-lists to be as fast as possible,
i decided to have per-device-structures for the receive-lists (which is
quite your suggestion). 

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I am not sure, if choosing single linked lists for &quot;next&quot; field in &quot;struct
</I>&gt;<i> rcv_list&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> is the right idea.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> af_can.h:27
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> struct rcv_list {
</I>&gt;<i> 	struct rcv_list *next;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If this result in O(n-opens) process blocking during new device
</I>recognition,
&gt;<i> that would not be so bad. But I can see the loops in can_rx_unregister()
</I>&gt;<i> which are run under rcv_lists_lock which means for each client
</I>&gt;<i> close. You block all bottom halves during that time, this is not polite to
</I>&gt;<i> real time applications. The read/write locks do not translate simply even
</I>on
&gt;<i> the fully preemptive kernel. I see similar problems in can_rx_unregister()
</I>&gt;<i> which even calls find_rcv_list() under the lock. Even totaly unbound
</I>kmalloc
&gt;<i> is called under the write lock. The global rcv_lists_lock is not big win
</I>if
&gt;<i> the more CAN controllers are used on SMP or HT system as well and you use
</I>&gt;<i> this global lock even in can_rcv(). This would result in cache trashing.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> We have maintained to keep almost all locking to be in O(1) scale in our
</I>queues
&gt;<i> approach and not held during any data copy operation operations and such
</I>hogs
&gt;<i> as kmalloc would be taken by me as homicide but we use these locking from
</I>&gt;<i> IRQ context so our requirements are more strict. You can look into my
</I>queues
&gt;<i> implementation
</I>&gt;<i>   lincan/src/can_queue.c
</I>&gt;<i>   lincan/include/can_queue.h
</I>&gt;<i> There is only very occasional loop in the case, that the dead (being
</I>removed)
&gt;<i> edge has to be skiped. Else direct fall through code is only protected.
</I>&gt;<i> Reference counting is used to ensure, that &quot;objects&quot; do not disappear
</I>during
&gt;<i> operation when no locks are held. Destroy is delayed. Reference counting
</I>&gt;<i> uses CMPXCHG to not require more spinlocking during reference release
</I>&gt;<i> for normal case. On the other hand our solution uses very huge amount
</I>&gt;<i> of very short locking which could be overhead in some cases. We preffered
</I>&gt;<i> this due to need to synchronize with hard-RT RT-Linux kernel in some build
</I>&gt;<i> scenarios. The often fine grained object specific irq save locking has not
</I>&gt;<i> so big overhead on standard kernels, but I admit, that it can have
</I>&gt;<i> considerable overhead on the fully preemptive kernel.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
Yep! Urs added the locks (which are currently under 'trunk') as a
safety-first action. In the Kernel 2.4 implementation there were no locks
(so it was not SMP-proof). The correct idea is to use hlists from the kernel
and rcu_locks for adding/removing receive-list-entries. The receive-list has
been designed to allow multiple reading by can_rcv() processing incoming
CAN-frames. The rcu_locks now give the security for inserting / removing
receive-list-entries. 

&gt;<i> But  may it be, that these problems are not so critical in your case,
</I>because
&gt;<i> most of SKB delivery processing is run by the kernel in the background in
</I>&gt;<i> the separate delayed processing so it has no influence to netif_rx()
</I>caller.
&gt;<i> But it has influence to RT application threads still when create queues
</I>&gt;<i> and has impact on messages delivery latencies.
</I>
For these RT-requirements the RT-socket-can implementation offers
non-networklayer-queues.
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> But what I see as more problematic is, that delivery to the processes is
</I>&gt;<i> handled
</I>&gt;<i> in the common process_backlog function. It is right, that it is called
</I>from
&gt;<i> per CPU thread and all is probably well tuned for throughput, but even
</I>delivery
&gt;<i> of messages for real-time threads could be blocked by complex delivery of
</I>huge
&gt;<i> patkets in different protocol family (video broadcast etc).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> CAN is basically not about throughput, 1MBd is neglectable today,
</I>&gt;<i> but it is about quick and deterministic delivery for which it is valued
</I>&gt;<i> in robotic, motion control and automotive aqpplications.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So there is most importatnt question for socket_can, does latency suffer
</I>from
&gt;<i> mixing SKBs with other protocols or not? I am not able to answer to this
</I>&gt;<i> after short analysis of your code. 
</I>
We never made any measurements as it is not that important for us, if the
CAN-frame arrives +/- 100 usecs. We never had any problems running
LAN/WLAN/CAN together which is our major area of application.

&gt;<i> Linux has not good responsiveness by
</I>&gt;<i> default,
</I>&gt;<i> but with fully preemptive kernel our approach allows to directly release
</I>&gt;<i> high priority processes when CAN message arrives and latency should
</I>&gt;<i> depend only on the priority of application thread and thread which
</I>&gt;<i> is provided by fully preemptive kernel as kernel thread for CAN IRQ
</I>&gt;<i> processing.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The problem could be solved, if input_pkt_queue would be moved to per
</I>device
&gt;<i> work queue which allows to tune right thread priority and would not
</I>compete 
&gt;<i> with other protocols bandwidth. There seems to be some attempts in this
</I>&gt;<i> direction
</I>&gt;<i> for 2.6 kernels, but I do not know, if there is chance that they catch.
</I>&gt;<i> I do not believe that there is chance for change in 2.4 kernels.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
I don't know if this solved the general problem as this would work only when
you have ONE process per device. But we're running more than 30 processes
gathering the information from more than one CAN-device at a time.

&gt;<i> There are another relatively minor things about your code which
</I>&gt;<i> could be checked.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I have not noticed even minimal attempt to prepare possibility to allow
</I>some
&gt;<i> control over messages Tx order (reaction to critical state should have
</I>some
&gt;<i> precedence over CANopen SDOs for example).
</I>
Puuh - you wan't the networklayer to decide about application-content? I
don't think that's a good thing to work on. The only thing i could imagine
is to sort the tx-queue inside the networklayer by CAN-ID (lowest first).
But maybe you will get into other trouble while other users do not want any
reordering of their messages - so even this idea looks broken.

&gt;<i> But may it be, that I have not noticed some hidden possibility in SKB
</I>layer.

If so there may be some extra protocol-socket (e.g. CAN_RAW_PRIO) that may
add the CAN-frames at the head of the tx-queue, for example ... this looks
as a fair compromise.
 
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The MSCAN utilizes delayed poll based receiption in kernel provided
</I>&gt;<i> NET_RX_SOFTIRQ soft IRQ. It is again problem with thread priorities
</I>&gt;<i> and mutual protocols load.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I think, that generic can_calc_bit_time() could be more generic to allow
</I>&gt;<i> computation for any device. The hardcoded constants (MAX_BIT_TIME ...)
</I>&gt;<i> should be eliminated in favor of some device provided pointer
</I>&gt;<i> to parameters structure. We do not have this in the LinCAN yet too, but if
</I>&gt;<i> you want to see such code I can provide it to you from other of our
</I>CANopen
&gt;<i> university experiments based on next prototypes
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> struct can_calc_const_t = {
</I>&gt;<i>   .unsigned sync,.sjw_max, tseg1_min, tseg1_max,
</I>&gt;<i>    tseg2_min, tseg2_max,.brp_min,.brp_max
</I>&gt;<i>   .brp_inc,.fix_div;
</I>&gt;<i> };
</I>&gt;<i> int can_auto_baud(long baud_rate, int *pbrp, int *ptseg1, int *ptseg2, int
</I>
&gt;<i> sampl_pt, can_calc_const_t *c)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Hm - i am not the timing specialist. I think Andrey Volkov is.
 
&gt;<i> But generally I agree, that your project is interesting
</I>&gt;<i> and that it would worth to try to manage CAN communication
</I>&gt;<i> that way. I hope, that I find time to port some of our test
</I>&gt;<i> utilities to your API and I try to compare latencies.
</I>&gt;<i> If socket_can latencies would not be significantly worse
</I>&gt;<i> than LinCAN ones, then I would vote for its inclussion into
</I>&gt;<i> vanilla. If I could find resources, people willing to
</I>&gt;<i> contribute  (university funding could be problem there),
</I>&gt;<i> then I think, that it would be good idea to try port
</I>&gt;<i> more of LinCAN suported cards code into this framework.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I do not expect, that we drop LinCAN at the moment,
</I>&gt;<i> because it is used by more companies and your solution would
</I>&gt;<i> not allow interoperability between hard-RT domain and linux
</I>&gt;<i> kernel context. But I believe, that after fully peemptive
</I>&gt;<i> patches are included into vanilla and maturation of your
</I>&gt;<i> code, it has potential to be unified Linux CAN solution.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The e-mail analysing your code is rather long but I think,

</I>&gt;<i> if you send these lists into your project mainlinglist to evoke
</I>&gt;<i> discussion which could in end help even to your project.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I am invited to RTLWS8 so if you go there we can meet.
</I>&gt;<i> I wanted to evoke discussion about Linux CAN unification
</I>&gt;<i> there and I have been preparing some materials for presentation
</I>&gt;<i> before your e-mail. Your project contributes significant change
</I>&gt;<i> in this area so I am not sure about my previous plans.
</I>&gt;<i> In each case, I wish the there is mature, agreed upon, open,
</I>&gt;<i> and non obfuscated CAN solution for Linux.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Best wishes
