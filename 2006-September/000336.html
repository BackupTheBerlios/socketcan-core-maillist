</I>&gt;&gt;<i> OK, so far you and Urs have been happy with the loopback solution in the 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Linux socket-can driver and you didn't miss the ability to switch it 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> off. Jan and I still prefer the implementation via protocol because we 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> want to keep it simple and are concerned about the RT latency. I think
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> a resonable minimal solution for the time being could be the use of:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 	socket(PF_CAN, SOCK_RAW, CAN_PROTO_NET); /* local loopback */
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 	socket(PF_CAN, SOCK_RAW, CAN_PROTO_DEVICE); /* no loopback */
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>          #define CAN_PROTO_NET 0     (or maybe better CAN_RAW_NET?)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>          #define CAN_PROTO_DEVICE 1  (or maybe bettr CAN_RAW_DEVICE?)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> As pointed out in another posting, a new protocol is simply not the
</I>&gt;<i> right way to do it, as it is not a different protocol, but only a
</I>&gt;<i> minor change in behavior of an existing protocol.  You send and
</I>&gt;<i> receive the same frames, you use the same sockaddr types, etc. the
</I>&gt;<i> only difference is where packets are delivered to.  It is a simple
</I>&gt;<i> on/off flag to control wether frames are looped back to local
</I>&gt;<i> listeners or not, and this is exactly what the {get,set}sockopt calls
</I>&gt;<i> where invented for.  There might be further similar flags in the
</I>&gt;<i> future which might be reasonable in combination with each other, and
</I>&gt;<i> you surely wouldn't want to define 2^n protocols for n such flags.  In
</I>&gt;<i> fact, we already have two such flags, one to control looping back in
</I>&gt;<i> general, and one to control looping back to the sending socket.  The
</I>&gt;<i> two options are
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     CAN_RAW_LOOPBACK to enable or disable loopback of packets to the
</I>&gt;<i>         sending interface.  The default is on, so that other sockets
</I>&gt;<i>         on the same machine will receive everything, that is sent on
</I>&gt;<i>         that interface, and not only what is sent from other hosts.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     CAN_RAW_RECV_OWN_MSGS to enable or disable reception of looped
</I>&gt;<i>         back packets by the sending socket.  The default is off to
</I>&gt;<i>         meet your expectations expressed here.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This means if you simply open a socket and don't use these socket
</I>&gt;<i> options you get exactly the behavior you wanted' i.e. you don't see
</I>&gt;<i> your own messages.  As long as you open only one socket on the same
</I>&gt;<i> host (which I understand is your normal use case) you won't see
</I>&gt;<i> anything looped back.  If you do run other sockets connected the same
</I>&gt;<i> CAN interface you will soon be happy that packets are looped back.  If
</I>&gt;<i> not, switch it off using the socket option.
</I>
Still, to loop-back the TX messages we have to disable interrupts, walk 
through the list of listeners and re-enable them. This will have some 
negative effect on the latency, especially if messages are sent at high 
rate. Therefore we prefer CAN_RAW_LOOPBACK to be off by default.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The default &quot;0&quot; is what your current implementation does. You have to 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> change nothing. If in the future, there is the need to change the 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> behavior as well, we could still implement an appropriate socket option.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The result would be what looks like a couple of ideas kludged together
</I>&gt;<i> by unkwnoledgeable people having misunderstood the whole point behind
</I>&gt;<i> the BSD socket API.  It would look like a an implementation driven
</I>&gt;<i> only be current needs without analyzing the whole thing for
</I>&gt;<i> similarities to utilize common patterns and the socket API provided
</I>&gt;<i> for this.  We would have two different ways (protocol selection and
</I>&gt;<i> socket option) to achieve the same thing.
</I>
I hope you are aware of our concerns, nevertheless...

&gt;<i> As mentioned above, we already have a solution and AFAICS, it will
</I>&gt;<i> meet your needs.  Try it, please.
</I>
... at least we have the interface defined now, if there are no further 
objections, and I'm going to implement in some way.

Thanks.

Wolfgang.
