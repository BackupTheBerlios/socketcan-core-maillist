<PRE>Hello,

as announced, I post the patches of our current quilt patch stack for
Socket-CAN revision 561 from Berlios. Each patch has some documentation
in the header. Here is a brief summary.

o bitrate-hw-independant.patch

  J&#252;rgens patch to set the CAN bit rate in HW-independent way:
<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/pipermail/socketcan-core/2007-October/000715.html">https://lists.berlios.de/pipermail/socketcan-core/2007-October/000715.html</A>

o sja1000-dev-interface.patch

  It provides the improved driver for the SJA1000 using the existing
  CAN device interface in &quot;drivers/net/can/sja1000dev&quot;. I have some
  further improvements concerning names in mind (prefixes), but that's
  a minor issue. I didn't want to change to much.

o sja1000-dev-err-frames.patch

  Adds the generation of error frames for the SJA1000 in case of error
  conditions.

o sja1000-dev-ixxat-pci.patch
o sja1000-dev-pcm027.patch
o sja1000-dev-ems-pci.patch
o sja1000-dev-peak-pci.patch

  PCI drivers for the PCI CAN devices from IXXAT, EMS W&#252;nsche and PEAK
  System and a platform driver for the SJA1000 on the Pnytech PCM027
  board. Adding other devices should simple.

o mscan-netdev-fixes.patch

  Fixes issues with changes in the netdev layer (NAPI, device stats)
  introduced with kernel version 2.6.24. Was needed for testing.

o can-dev-proc.patch

  Permits to list CAN device parameters and counters via
  /proc/net/dev_can. It was already useful for debugging and testing.

o can-config-util.patch

  Adds adds the CAN utility &quot;canconfig&quot; to set the baudrate, to change
  the CAN controller mode, to re-start the CAN controller or to query
  the state and other parameters

Not yet perfect but a big step forward, I think. Regard these patches as
a starting point towards an improved CAN device interface. Here is a
list of issues/threads I have in mind which needs discussion and
clarification:

1. CAN bit rate setting:

   Default CAN bit rate calculation and custom bit rate setting in a
   more hardware independent way. See thread
<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/pipermail/socketcan-core/2007-October/000715.html.">https://lists.berlios.de/pipermail/socketcan-core/2007-October/000715.html.</A>


2. CAN state management:

   How should the CAN state be managed? We have the common &quot;state&quot;
   variable of the CAN device interface and the do_get_state() method.
   I see two methods:

   - the common &quot;state&quot; variable is updated in the ISR and it always
     hold the proper state. There's no need for do_get_state().

   - if do_get_state(), it should return the proper state.

   Part of it could be handled in common code.


3. Controller start and re-start:

   When and how should the controller be restarted? I see the following
   three methods:

   - via ifconfig up/down

   - via automatic restart in case of persistent error condition or
     TX timeout (do we really need that?).

   - via ioctl request SIOCGCANCTRLMODE / CAN_MODE_START

   A restart may also be triggered by a baud-rate setting. The restart
   behavior should also be configurable when the driver is statically
   linked into the kernel (no module parameters).


4. PROCFS support for common and specific properties, e.g.:

   $ cat /proc/net/dev_can
   i-face can-clock bitrate canstate err-warn err-pass buserrors
overruns arb-lost wakeups restarts
     can0   8000000  125000   active        5        3        92
0        0       0        6
     can1   8000000  500000  stopped        0        0         0
0        0       0        0


6. Feature RX-Probe:

   See
<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/pipermail/socketcan-core/2007-November/000789.html">https://lists.berlios.de/pipermail/socketcan-core/2007-November/000789.html</A>

7. ... likely I have forgotten something.


Minor issues and 2nd step ideas and improvements:

o CAN device statistics:

  I think it is to much biased by the SJA1000. It actually counts
  the error interrupt sources of the SJA1000.

o Using (N)NAPI, rx-poll for SJA1000 to deal better with high interrupt
  load, especially bus error flooding (check MSCAN driver).

o Using SYSFS to set device properties as replacement for module
  parameters.


Please comment.

Wolfgang.
