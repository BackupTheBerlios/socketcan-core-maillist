<PRE>Hello,

to check the current status of Socket-CAN at BerliOS, I &quot;manually&quot; 
integrated &quot;socketcan/kernel/2.6&quot; into the Linux 2.6.18 kernel and built 
it for my Icecube-MPC5200 board. [Note that it requires some additional 
patches to get the PPC kernel tree working for the MPC5200]. I did some 
basic testing (RX and TX) with MSCAN and here is a list of my 
observations and the problems I encountered:


MSCAN/MPC5200:

- Some modifications are required to get the MSCAN/MPC5200 driver built
   and working (see attached preliminary patch &quot;socketcan-mscan.patch&quot;).
   Be aware that there is a problem with resource management, which will
   change again with the new PowerPC tree. Therefore I added the CAN
   system clock frequency and source &quot;manually&quot;. I would prefer to define
   kernel options for the clock frequency and IRQ routing. Furthermore I
   fixed a problem in the ISR with unhandled IRQs. Andrew, could you
   please check the fixes, thanks.

- The baud-rate setting is working but it would be nice to have a
   default setting via module parameter.


CAN protocol and SJA1000:

- &quot;net/can/dev.c&quot; can be built as module and should therefore have the
   usual module definitions, like MODULE_AUTHOR, MODULE_LICENSE, etc.

- &quot;net/can/Kconfig&quot;: I think &quot;source drivers/net/can/Kconfig&quot; should
   go to &quot;drivers/net/Kconfig&quot;.

- I think there should be a &quot;drivers/can/&lt;controller&gt;/Kconfig&quot; for each
   controller.

- I think the Makefiles could be simplified.

- &quot;drivers/can/sja1000/Makefile&quot;:
   o CONFIG_CAN_SJA1000 is not used.
   o the SJA1000 driver cannot be statically linked into the kernel.

- It seems, that the diver of the SJA1000 controller is bundled with the
   board specific driver, e.g. it is currently not possible to use it for
   more than one SJA1000 device type at a time. Have I missed something?
   I think there should be a kernel driver module for the SJA1000
   controller on one for each SJA1000 device type.

- Missing features in the SJA1000 driver:

   o Various SIO[SG]* settings for baudrate, mode and controller-mode.
     They can be implemented as for MSCAN. The infrastructure in dev.c is
     already available. Note that &quot;set_baud&quot; in sja1000.c is than
     obsolete.

- Sooner than later a kernel patch for socketcan is required. I think
   the simplest way is to provide a script to add socketcan to the kernel
   and generate a patch.

- Further comments:

   o A common naming scheme for the modules would be nice, also for the
     drivers, e.g. can-sja1000-isa.ko, can-mscan-mpc5200.ko.

   o The bit timing calculation in dev.c does not return the usual BTR0/1
     values for the SJA1000, e.g. BTR0 = 0x03, BTR1 = 0x1C for 125 KB/s.
     This might be confusing. In RT-Socket-CAN I use a different method
     to calculate BTR0 and BTR1 (actually the one from the PCAN driver).

That's the result of my quick socketcan check. Comments are welcome.

Wolfgang.
