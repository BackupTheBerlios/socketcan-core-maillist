</I>
Note that this CAN controller is *very* special. It cannot handle all
CAN id's due to a lack or resources. The PRUSS firmware is able to
manage just up to 8 different CAN identifiers out of the usual 4096
(12-bit) or even more for the extended CAN ids using 29 bits. There is
no other CAN controller with such rather serious limitations and
therefore there exists also no appropriate interface. I think using
sysfs is OK for such device-specific parameters, at least for the time
being.

&gt;<i> How hard would it be to implement that feature in Socket CAN?
</I>
CAN controllers usually provide some kind of hardware CAN id filtering,
but in a very hardware dependent way. A generic interface may be able to
handle the PRUSS restrictions as well. CAN devices are usually
configured through the netlink interface. e.g.

  $ ip link set can0 up type can bitrate 125000

and such a common interface would be netlink based as well.

&gt;<i> Is that something that Subhasish or someone else could to as a prerequisite
</I>&gt;<i> to merging the driver?
</I>
Any ideas on how to handle hardware filtering in a generic way are
welcome. I will try to come up with a proposal sooner than later.

Wolfgang.
