<PRE>Hello,

here is a brief summary of my on-going effort to implement the new CAN
device interface and the reference driver for the SJA1000. So far, I
have applied the following improvements and new features to the
Socket-CAN branch &quot;cannetdriver26&quot;:

o Code clean-up and name changes

  - Lindent and manual beautification on various files.
  - Name change &quot;baudrate&quot; -&gt; &quot;bitrate&quot;
  - Name change &quot;bit_time&quot; -&gt; &quot;bittime&quot;
  - Module name change &quot;candev.ko&quot; -&gt; &quot;can-dev.ko&quot;.
  - Obsolete code has been removed.
  - Typedefs have been cleaned up.
  - TX timeout functions have been removed from the device drivers.
  - Rename function names &quot;can_*&quot; into &quot;sja1000_*&quot; in sja1000.c.


o CAN state management

  The following CAN error states are handled by the SJA1000 and MSCAN
  driver:

    typedef enum {
	CAN_STATE_ACTIVE=0
	CAN_STATE_BUS_WARNING,
	CAN_STATE_BUS_PASSIVE,
	CAN_STATE_BUS_OFF,
	CAN_STATE_STOPPED,
    } can_state_t;

  The CAN error states are set properly in the ISR and an error frame
  is generated when the state changes. The do_get_state() function is
  implemented for debugging purposes and will be remove soon. For MSCAN
  it's a bit more tricky, unfortunately.


o SYSFS support

  IOCTL request have been removed in favor of the following SYSFS files:

    # cd /sys/class/net/can0
    # ls -1 `find  -name 'can_*'`
    ./can_bitrate
    ./can_clock
    ./can_ctrlmode
    ./can_custombittime
    ./can_echo
    ./can_restart
    ./can_restart_ms
    ./can_state

    ./can_statistics:
    arbitration_lost
    bus_error
    data_overrun
    error_passive
    error_warning
    restarts
    wakeup

  We need to discuss sometime later what we really want to list under
  &quot;can_statistics&quot;. The current implementation is biased by the
  SJA1000.


o CAN start, stop, re-start and bus-off recovery:

  The CAN device must be started with &quot;ifconfig up&quot; and stopped with
  &quot;ifconfig down&quot;. In case of bus-off it can be re-started manually by
  writing to the SYSFS file &quot;/sys/class/net/can*/can_restart&quot;. And if
  /sys/class/net/can*/can_restart_ms&quot; is greater than 0, it gets
  re-started automatically after the specified time.

  Bus-off and automatic re-start is handled by a common interface:

  - In case of bus-off, the device driver calls can_bus_off(), which
    calls netif_carrier_off() and eventually adds a timer to schedule
    the automatic re-start. At manual or automatic restart time, the
    function can_restart_now() mainly calls:

    * can_flush_echo_skb(dev);
    * priv-&gt;do_set_mode(dev, CAN_MODE_START);
    * netif_carrier_on(dev);
    * priv-&gt;can_stats.restarts++;
    * format a CAN_ERR_RESTARTED error frame and send it upstream.
    * update statistics

  This means that the device driver has to perform the bus-off recovery
  or re-start in its do_set_mode() function. When the device is closed
  the device driver should call can_close_cleanup() to stop the timer.

  This interface may need refinement in case of delayed bus-off
  recovery. I have to check the doc more carefully first. Maybe
  we need an additional can_bus_on() function when the bus-off
  recovery interrupt finally arrives.


o Bitrate setting

  There are the following rules:

  - The bitrate can *not* be modified when the device is active.
    &quot;ifconfig down&quot; must be called first.

  - Currently we have the following macro definitions for bitrates:

    #define CAN_BITRATE_UNCONFIGURED	((__u32) 0xFFFFFFFFU)
    #define CAN_BITRATE_UNKNOWN		0
    #define CAN_BITRATE_DEFAULT		500000

  - A default bitrate is used and set in common code when the driver is
    registered. It is currently defined by CAN_BITRATE_DEFAULT in
    ioctl.h but we may want to have an additional module paramter of
    can-dev.ko for overwrite it. Comments?
    Note that the device driver can define and set its own, non
    standard bitrate and timing. For this purpose I have implemented a
    common can_set_bitrate() function.

  As you know, we want to have a re-vised bit-time setting, which we
  should discuss sooner than later.


o Echoing skbs:

  There is now a simple common interface using an array of skb pointers:

    struct can_priv {
          ...
	  struct sk_buff *echo_skb[CAN_ECHO_SKB_MAX];

  - The drivers start_xmit function calls before returning:

      can_put_echo_skb(skb, dev, idx):

  - When TX is done the corrsponding ISR should call:

      can_get_echo_skb(dev, idx);

  - can_flush_echo_skb(dev) is called when the device is restarted
    or closed. The device driver should call can_close_cleanup() in its
    stop function.

  - The driver should enable support for echoing skbs in its
    registration function:

      dev-&gt;flags |= IFF_ECHO;

  - It can be disabled/enabled using the SYSFS file can_echo.

  So far, this works fine for SJA1000 and MSCAN.


o Supported CAN controllers and devices:

  Currently there is support for:

  - SJA1000 on PCAN PEAK PCI Cards
  - SJA1000 on EMS CPC PCI Cards
  - SJA1000 on IXXAT PCI cards
  - SJA1000 on Phytec PCM027 boards
  - MSCAN on the MPC5200

What do you think? Comments, improvements, new CAN device
drivers and patches are welcome.

Wolfgang.
