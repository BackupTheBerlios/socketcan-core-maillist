Hi Anant,

the concept behind the SocketCAN approach is to make the CAN interfaces as
simple as ethernet interfaces.

So hardware specific features (like 32 TX-buffers) are intentionally not used.

Think about using 2-3 TX-buffers that allow the CAN controller to transmit on
maximum throughput, as they are able to write the next CAN frame into a
TX-buffer while a CAN frame is currently transmitted.

I'm currently working on some ideas how to handle CAN priorities and Multiuser
CAN traffic needs with Linux network queueing disciplines (qdiscs).

But the driver itself remains with quite dumb behaviour with not more than 2-3
TX-buffers, as you would like to have the same qdisc behaviour on a SJA1000,
mscan, ti_hecc and whatever ...

Regards,
Oliver
