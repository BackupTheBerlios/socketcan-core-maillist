Yep. The 'wake' pin is some kind of additional input to wake the system not
only by detecting CAN traffic. E.g. you could attach a RTC or something else
here ...

Please check the schematic on page &quot;15 of 26&quot; from

  <A HREF="http://www.nxp.com/acrobat/datasheets/TJA1041_6.pdf">http://www.nxp.com/acrobat/datasheets/TJA1041_6.pdf</A>

This is the common application for fault tolerant transceivers that support
the sleep modes.

You need to set EN and /STB in order to set the transceiver into the sleep
mode - see table 4 in chapter 7.1.

Usually EN and /STB are both set to 1 (or open collector) and when you want to
go to sleep, you need to perform the steps

1. Set /STB and EN to 1 (default)
2. Set /STB to 0 and EN to 1
3. Set /STB and EN to 0

And then the INH line switches to off and kills your power supply :-)

Our system makes a usleep(500000) (to wait for power loss) and then executes a
system reset, e.g. when CAN traffic just re-appeared and the INH line did no
do it's job.

So for the TJA1041 we would need:

EN, /STB and /ERR to be connected to the CPU via GPIO.

A real goodie would be to connect /ERR to an interrupt line that also detects
state changes - but this is not really needed.

I'll take a look on other 'intelligent' transceivers, if there are any
requirements that exceed the described TJA1041 / TJA1054 needs.

Regards,
Oliver
