</I>I regard the PGN similar to the port in sockaddr_in. In the inet case,
   it is addressing info.

</I>I'm not that familiar with isotp.
Is looks indeed indentification of the 'Protocol Data Unit' or PDU. But
j1939 defines it nowhere within the data. the PGN is used in a 1-to-1
mapping towards CAN identifiers.
May I assume that ISO15765-2 needs a (userspace) lookup table to know
which PDU to send with which can_id? Such approach makes sense, but
j1939 is not built that way. It has a direct mapping from PDU to can_id.
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Therefore the __u16 PGN should be the first data in the PDU that's written
</I>detail: PGN is combined PS (group extension), PF, DP &amp; RES bit, with a
total of 18 bits.
J1939 itself does not make use of a DP=1, but nmea2000  (built on j1939)
does make use of it. My first use of nmea2000 GPS receivers added this
problem that I had to start evaluating the DP too.
I'll read the following with __u32 PGN :-) (since __u18 is no data type).
&gt;<i> into the socket - as we do with the SI in ISO15765-2. We also have the CAN-ID
</I>&gt;<i> in the CAN_RAW socket in the skb-&gt;data and the first element in the PDU we get
</I>&gt;<i> from the socket. The fact that the PGN is encoded inside the CAN-ID is a J1939
</I>&gt;<i> specific fact that is independent(!) from dynamic/static addressing in J1939.
</I>I see your point. indeed, the PGN is independant of the addressing used.
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This leads to the following suggestions:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> - the PGN is always the first __u16 in the PDU that's read/written from/to the
</I>&gt;<i> socket.
</I>in iso11783-6 (aka ISOBUS), an extended version of the transport
protocol is defined, allowing packets or sessions up to ((2^24)-1)*7
bytes. the API would be hell if the fist __u32 PGN must be prepended
with write, since eache seperate write( or send) generates a seperate
packet. A CAN packet is limited to 16 bytes _ever_. a j1939 packet can
grow big. _requiring_ an PGN prepended results in _requiring_ the
packet be built in RAM. And that I don't want to require.
This (j1939) does not imply anything on the choices made for
CAN raw.
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> - We introduce two types of CAN protocols (supported by _one_ can-j1939.ko)
</I>&gt;<i>     - CAN_J1939 for static addressing
</I>&gt;<i>     - CAN_J1939DA for dynamic addressing
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> - CAN_J1939 and CAN_J1939DA have different address structures (of course)
</I>This idea crossed my mind earlier. It would indeed be less
error-sensitive. But, both CAN_J1939 &amp; CAN_J1939DA do operate on the
same protocol level, and they can mix.
In fact, I believe that due to network complexity, CAN_J1939DA would be
used most frequently, and due to footprint, CAN_J1939 would be needed to
communicate with low-end devices (remote sensors etc). The problem that
one would get mixing static &amp; dynamic addressing is rather
theoretical, since on a real bus, the possible static addresses on
the bus are known to the application (but not the kernel stack).
A real situation is a Display device, needing dynamic addressing,
starting with eg. 0x27. Would a second display be connected, it would
take some other address. But only 0x27 is able to communicate with
a certain low-end ECU on the bus. As such, the second display can
not talk to the low-end ECU. It can only listen to the
(broadcasted messages from such ECU).

My current implemenation does allow with 1 socket to participate in
dynamic addressing, but sending/listening to a remote ECU with a static
address. When static &amp; dynamic gets seperate sockets, we would loose
such capability, unless an extra field was added to the sockaddr_can,
but that would make things really difficult.
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> - when sending PDUs the PGN is given inside the PDU
</I>&gt;<i> - when receiving PDUs the PGN is given inside the PDU
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> - on the receiver side the PGNs can be filtered analogue to the CAN-ID filters
</I>&gt;<i> configured by sockopts - if needed.
</I>I had something similar implemented (not speed optimised yet). Very soon
in j1939, the sk_buff is reworked so it only contains data, and the
addressing info is put int skb-&gt;cb.
This approach is needed to filter on SA or NAME anyway.
I don't think the PGN must reside in the skb-&gt;data.
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This approach clearly separates the different J1939 addressing from the
</I>&gt;<i> content that's defined by the PGNs.
</I>see first comment wrt. inet.
I see no problem in combining address with PGN. I see more problems in
combining PGN with data.

</I>detail: I think the seperation into different fields really belongs to

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> For me it's the first definition that makes clear what needs to be done by the
</I>&gt;<i> application to send PGNs to specific ECUs at first sight.
</I>Like I mentioned earlier, I compare J1939 addressing &amp; PGN more like
UDP. During our investigation on how to approach this, we found a DHCP
server very similar (ip address, port number, recvfrom() &amp; sendto(),
      ....) in how we want to use j1939.
I think the comparison with UDP is closer than with isotp, although
isotp may be better in its use of can_id's.

I think your idea is creative, but I don't think it improves the API,
  given the use of j1939 I encountered.
But your argument is probably a valid one, in the way that the regular
BSD socket API is seldom consulted in CAN environments.
I think on addressing that in Documentation/networking/j1939.txt.
for example:

  BSD sockets define a local &amp; remote address. Since both include the PGN, and
  j1939 needs 1 PGN to send a packet, the local address' PGN is used for outgoing
  packets, ie. the PGN of sockaddr_can used in bind(2).
  The PGN in the call to connect(2) is never used for outgoing packets.
  When using sendto(2), the new PGN takes precedence
  over the PGN defined during bind(2), without overwriting it for subsequent
  calls to send(2) or write(2), which still will use the PGN from bind(2).

I still believe that

  struct {
     __u64 name;
     __u8 addr;
     __u32 pgn;
  } j1939;

is the most essential, easy-to-document structure. It matches the BSD
socket API _very_ close. Any change would imply added complexity in
other regions. It is much cleaner than the first proposal I made.
Therefore I'm glad to have had the discussion.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; We coud so reduce the application choice between static &amp;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; dynamic addressing to just choosing between j1939.name &amp; j1939.addr, rather
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; than choosing between API calls.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Yes, this choice can be made wrong. When j1939.name is set, but not
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; used, users might experience problems. I bet this will occur much
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; sooner if they would need to get the name elsewhere (via cmsg()).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The biggest challenge with documenting this j1939 approach IMO is learn
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; typical CAN/J1939 users to think in terms of local &amp; remote addresses in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; a BSD socket compliant way, rather than combining local &amp; remote address
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; in 1 can_id (as I also did when I started 10 years ago, I'm not blaming
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; anyone here).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The dynamic thing is minor challenge in documenting the api, given that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; using it is not too difficult.
