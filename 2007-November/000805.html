We have a reworked SJA1000 driver in the pipeline.

I'd very much prefer patches in svn, which is much easier to rebase to
several kernels. At the moment we are again maintaining our own
socket-can patch queue, because you are already on 2.6.24-rc and we have
to ship customer kernels on top of 2.6.23. Drivers are orthogonal
enough, so it should be no problem to keep them in quilt stacks.

&gt;<i> Should we use a different revision control system or a git for the CAN
</I>&gt;<i> netdriver development? SVN is fine for me as it works through
</I>&gt;<i> http-proxies.
</I>
Please, let's stay with either the current variant or that one outlined
above. I know that everyone thinks git is the best rcs since sliced
bread, but it is not the solution for everything and creates a bunch of
new problems. Let's please focus on the code, not on tools.

&gt;<i> Should we create a branch for driver development? And if we go for a
</I>&gt;<i> different system like git for the drivers - who could host &amp; maintain
</I>&gt;<i> it? Questions over questions ...  The SVN and the possibility of
</I>&gt;<i> external(!) compilation turned out to be a very good approach to me in
</I>&gt;<i> the past.
</I>
We'll probably stay with 2.6.23 until socket-can is finally merged
(unless there is some other customer requirement). So for us it would
especially be interesting to see how to get the missing technological
things in place, like the still mostly undiscussed question of bittime
tables.
