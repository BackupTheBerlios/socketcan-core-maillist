<PRE>Hello,

I am working on converting mcp251x driver to spi_async from synchronous and
facing some issues: (hardware is custom board with AT91SAM9260 MCU and
MCP2515 connected through SPI to MCU)

At tarnsmit side (mcp251x_hard_start_xmit) and doing spi_async call rather
than spi_sync function call for data transfer. It is working fine but after
transferring data, we have to set TXREQ bit in TXBCTRL to mark buffer for
transmission. But when I try to do async transfer for this write_reg command
then kernel crashes at &quot;PC is at atmel_spi_msg_done&quot; and &quot;LR is at
cs_deactivate&quot;. If I do async buffer transfer and sync register write then
its working without any problem.

I tried doing async write for TXREQ bit in complete_fn called after doing
async data-transfer then kernel crashes when mcp251x_can_isr is called first
time and kernel is at &quot;PC is at atmel_spi_next_xfer&quot; and &quot;LR is at
atmel_spi_interrupt&quot;.

I also used spin_lock with and without irqsave but the behaviour is same.

It will be good if I can get some hints on this issue.

Thanks in advance,
