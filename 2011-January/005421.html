Yes. But the missing point is that you can ideally have multiple of these
'boxes' running on one single host to simulate a complete environment
consisting of multiple nodes.

E.g. having one 'real' J1939 ECU on the CAN bus an having four ECUs running on
your host.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> IMHO the addresses for CAN protocols need to be specified on a per-socket

</I>&gt;<i> SocketCAN bus). As such, I can have 1 app just spitting out 1 second status message,
</I>&gt;<i> 1 app sending DM1 msgs, 1 app sending regular IO updates, ....
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> When adding addresses per socket, each app will need to know what
</I>&gt;<i> SA it is supposed to work with, which leads to malconfigurations ...
</I>
This is really a configuration point. I'm pretty sure this can be solved in
some way ... e.g. by introducing groups of sockets that use the space in
sockaddr_can for the definition of group identifiers. Or just by ensuring a
proper configuration of the applications (e.g. on the commandline).

If you misconfigure your routing you also get cut from the network ... and no
one provides configuration airbags to you :-)

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I rather compare the addressing of J1939 with IP, or at least I'd like
</I>&gt;<i> to deal with them in the same way. A node may use e.g. 0x80, but if I
</I>&gt;<i> want that to change to 0x81, I change it on 1 place and all traffic changes
</I>&gt;<i> with me. ...
</I>
Do you know why people invented VLANs or multiple IPs bound to a single
ethernet interface? So far you missed that step entirely.


&gt;<i> I'm quite convinced my concept here is right.
</I>
I'm pretty sure it is not, as it does not allow the use-case acting as
multiple ECUs on one host as described above.

Oliver
