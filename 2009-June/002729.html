thanks I'll try and report ASAP

</I>&gt;<i> The patch looks OK. To spot functional problems, I'm reviewing the patched

</I>
ok, I'll fix the problens you suggested and resubmit ASAP. I'll take
out as many dev_dbg as it seems doable.

</I>
ack, checkpatch.pl didn't complain so I haven't noticed ;-)

</I>&gt;<i> &#160; 234 &#160;#endif
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> DEBUG_IO? What is it good for?
</I>
well this is &quot;desperate mode&quot; debugging aid, so we know everything the
chip is telling us. I'll take it away anyway since without a good
knowledge of the chip it's not that useful and it's very noisy.

</I>&gt;<i> &#160; 272 &#160;}
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The above pattern is repeated quite often throughout this file. It could make
</I>&gt;<i> sense to introduce a dedicated function, e.g. mcp251x_spi_transfer();
</I>

&gt;<i> &#160; 668 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;mcp251x_do_set_bittiming(net);

</I>&gt;<i> Please do not set a default bit-timing! If open_candev() fails, just

&gt;<i> &#160; 766 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;priv-&gt;tx_len = 0;
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; 767 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;}
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This pattern is repeated a few times. Extra function? Can you
</I>&gt;<i> explain to me under which conditions priv-&gt;tx_skb and priv-&gt;tx_len
</I>&gt;<i> are NULL?
</I>
let's say it's &quot;defensive programming&quot;. I'll change it in a more &quot;bug
hunting&quot; style. Anyway:

tx_skb == NULL &amp;&amp; tx_len == 0 =&gt; no paacket was transmitted with hard_xmit_start
tx_skb != NULL &amp;&amp; tx_len == 0 =&gt; hard_xmit_start has been run, but the
work queue hasn't
tx_skb == NULL &amp;&amp; tx_len != 0 =&gt; the work queue has been run but the
hardware hasn't finished yet

all other combinations should be BUG() and I'll change the code to put
this in evidence.

Unfortunately the driver is complicated by the fact that we cannot do
spi I/O in a conteext that doesn't allow sleeping (well async
submission could be used but it would make the code quite a bit more
complicated).


&gt;<i> &#160; 786 &#160;}
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Can be removed as the upper layer already does it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; 787
</I>
ack

&gt;<i> &#160; 796 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;if (priv-&gt;tx_skb) {
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; 797 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;frame = (struct can_frame *)priv-&gt;tx_skb-&gt;data;

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think mcp251x_hw_tx() may fail, right?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
ack I'll check this condition.

&gt;<i> &#160; 831 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;can_free_echo_skb(net, 0);
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Hm, can_free_echo_skb() will free priv-&gt;tx_skb as well. Can that happen?
</I>
ack, see above.

&gt;<i> &#160; 993 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;netif_carrier_on(net);
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Does the controller recover from bus-off automatically? It's up to the
</I>&gt;<i> user to decide what to do and therefore the netif_carrier_on() is not
</I>&gt;<i> legal here.
</I>
yes, the controller automatically restarts tx/rx of the already
programmed mailboxes when the bus comes alive. I have to admit that I
copied this code fragment from other drivers. Anyway isn't
netif_carrier_on just a feedback that the link is now active, is it?
The decision to restart transmission is done by netif_start_queue (and
this is the generic can-dev code so under user control). I'm not
really sure about this point, so I'll check it.

&gt;<i> &#160;1287 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;.resume &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; = mcp251x_can_resume,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A CONFIG_PM would be more transparent, I think.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
ack, I'll saw the other idiom in many places, anyway it's just a
matter of code style.


thanks for the review I'll resubmit ASAP.
