</I>ok, I'll try to address this question ...

</I>on a pure j1939 network, a box is intended to use only de addresses given above.
I assume that a given box can use multiple addressess, each of them configured
with '$ ip addr add ...'
&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> IMHO the addresses for CAN protocols need to be specified on a per-socket
</I>&gt;<i> basis - and not as a system-wide restriction bound to CAN interfaces.
</I>I disagree here. The way I look at it, is that an CAN device will get
1 (or more, but that a bit more complicated to expleain) SA. Whichever application
that binds, will now use that SA. I can then build up my device by different
applications, cooperating to form a single entity on CAN (even within the virtual
SocketCAN bus). As such, I can have 1 app just spitting out 1 second status message,
1 app sending DM1 msgs, 1 app sending regular IO updates, ....

When adding addresses per socket, each app will need to know what
SA it is supposed to work with, which leads to malconfigurations ...

I rather compare the addressing of J1939 with IP, or at least I'd like
to deal with them in the same way. A node may use e.g. 0x80, but if I
want that to change to 0x81, I change it on 1 place and all traffic changes
with me. ...

I'm quite convinced my concept here is right.

Regards,
Kurt
