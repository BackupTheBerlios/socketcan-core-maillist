This was not a real problem yet.

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> It's just your opinion. I don't want to start an ideology debate about

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> That's my personal opinion, of course.
</I>&gt;<i> Everyone knows, the staging tree holds crap. Why not push our crap to

</I>
Generally, we don't have crap in the SVN repository. It's not a big
effort to update most of the drivers for kernel inclusion. But somebody
with the hardware at hand must take care and do it. The staging tree is
*not* for development. It serves a different purpose. For me, it's out
of discussion.

&gt;<i> The SVN repository will still be used for example applications and the
</I>&gt;<i> 2.4 tree, and maybe for patches to get a specific driver to work for 2.6.22.
</I>
I agree that we should move the drivers and can-utils to git sooner than
later... and finally get rid of the SVN repository. For the time being I
(we?) have different priorities. Marc, what is your opinion? You known
well what effort it is to maintain GIT repositories.

Wolfgang.
