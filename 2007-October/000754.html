When does the read() return ENOBUFS? Immediately when the next read() is 
processed or after all previous messages in the queue are read.

&gt;<i> Again: How has rtcan solved this problem?
</I>
With RT-Socket-CAN we see the same behaviour. It's even worse because a 
printf switches to secondary (non-real-time) mode. When the RX buffer of 
the socket is full, the message is discarded and &quot;sock-&gt;rx_buf_full&quot; is 
increased. This variable can be inspected via /proc/rtcan/sockets. 
Furthermore, in debug mode a printk is issued, which can make trouble in 
case the rate is high. The overflow is actually not reported to the app 
and returning a ENOBUFS on read() does make little sense to me because 
the queue is full. I can not even send an error frame.

Wolfgang.
