Hi Wolfgang,

additionally to 'classic' CAN netdev operations, e.g. the PEAK USB Adapters
have at least these functionalities:

- get the device specific serial number (a very common usecase)
- set a device number (one byte)
- get this device number

And the PEAK PCCARD can be configured at runtime to enable a +5V output on Pin
1 of the Sub-D 9 to power a CAN phy adapter.

These are only four cases i have in mind and i assume there are lot's more in
the ESD, SOFTING and EMS hardware (to be hopefully complete with the product
placement ;-)

As you already suggested the firmware updates should use the firmware
infrastructure provided by the Linux kernel.

This could be done like this:

1. check if there is a firmware available in lib/firmware/...
2. check if that fw is different to the device fw
3. if yes, upload the fw to the device

---

When using dev_info e.g. the serial number needs to be determined by 'greping'
whatever in dmesg - i don't think this is suitable.

Another point is the currently missing udev support:

E.g. we created a tricky scripting solution to determine the PEAK USB device
number from 'cat /proc/pcan' to set the appropriate bitrate and rename the
hotplugged USB Adapter to a fix predefined netdevice name.

Finally it turns out that providing a device specific identifier (e.g. a
hardware serial number) is really needed as this scripting solution is not
really a good and reusable approach.

To get the Vendor information, Serial Number, etc. could be also a interesting
 information for GUI-based CAN applications to display.

IMHO we

1. need to provide some information that can be used for udev (in sysfs!)
2. need to provide a netlink based interface for vendor specific functions
like setting the +5V on Pin1, enabling features, etc ...

But i don't know in detail what should be added to the sysfs or what can be
re-used ...

Regards,
Oliver
