Yes. I was thinking to use NAPI (rx poll), but that would result in
longer latencies.

&gt;<i> It's interesting to note that CAN is about RT but Linux RT kernels are

</I>
The SJA1000 can buffer up to 64 bytes, which is not that bad. CAN
produces one interrupt per message, which could put heavy load onto the
system. Catching up at full rate is a challenge for low-end systems,
indeed. Fortunately, in real applications there are normally not that
much CAN messages flying around. Note that bus-errors on the SJA1000
(and some other controllers) may be triggered at full rate, which may
result in the infamous bus-error flooding. We try to solve this issue
with NAPI (like for the AT91 CAN).

Wolfgang.
