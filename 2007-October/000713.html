Hm - i also do not have it. But i've checked several CAN controller 
specs &amp; ISO 11898-3 (TTCAN) this night ...

&gt;<i> The same driver is used for both the address claim phase, and then the
</I>&gt;<i> normal bus transfers.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Ah! - You have different 'phases' here, which may tell us, that you do 
not run in single-shot mode and normal operation mode at the same time 
on the wire :-)

To shortly summarize my investigations, it looks like ...

1. the single-shot mode is not provided by every CAN controller

2. only the SJA1000 can switch between single-shot and normal operation 
on a frame base

3. TTCAN compatible controllers (like AT89C51CC02) have a dedicated 
TTCAN mode that enables single-shot (only here!)

In TTCAN you have to run single-shot even in the &quot;Arbitrating Time 
Window&quot; so that the timing window remains guaranteed for the other 
(fixed) time windows. Finally from what i've read and discussed with 
experienced colleagues i would summarize that having single-shot frames 
and normal operation frames on the wire at the same time is not a valid 
use-case. For that reason i would tend to put the controlling of this 
medium access configuration into the driver and not to provide a user 
interface which may lead to an inconsistent node behaviour when 
generating a mix of different CAN frames transfer modes in a single 
context/mode/phase. This was just a gud feeling before but after reading 
all that documentation, i'm quite sure that single-shot or normal 
operation needs to be a bus-wide consistent setting for a given use-case.

&gt;<i> At the level of code which is dispatching the CAN
</I>&gt;<i> frames it seems wrong to have awareness of what phase of usage the bus
</I>&gt;<i> is in (address claim or normal transfers) - rather we are just told to
</I>&gt;<i> send the packet single shot or not single shot by the layer above.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
As you wrote you can split up the communication in an 'address claim 
phase' and a 'normal bus transfer' phase. For that reason, i would _not_ 
assume these phases to toggle rapidly (at least i assume them to switch 
one time: on and off). To solve this problem, you just could check in 
which mode the CAN-frame has to be sent and to switch the appropriate 
mode in the CAN-controller, if it's not already in that mode. This 
should be necessary only two times in the address claim phase then.

Any concerns left?

Regards,
Oliver
