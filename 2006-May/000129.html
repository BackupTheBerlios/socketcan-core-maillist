<PRE>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Currently no one. I think, it is an update to can_ioctl.h.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Unforunately i am on an internal fair the next days, but i 
</I>&gt;<i> think i can do it
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; on Friday.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> Ok, I checked can_bittime in (see can.h).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Also I added can_device object and new file can_generic.c as 
</I>&gt;<i> a place for
</I>&gt;<i> a common can_device related staff.

Hey Andrey,

what's going on here? The file can.h descibes the struct can_frame and
everything you need from the can-driver, from the af_can-core and the
user-space to handle CAN-messages. And not more.

The can_bittime stuff therefore has to go to can_ioctl.h as i mentioned in
my last posting - NOT in can.h.

On the other hand you changed the struct can_frame which we defined in a
long discussion in the beginning of this year. After the confirmation from
all of you the struct can_frame is FIXED! It is already IN PRODUCTION. You
have to change every can-driver, every user application, etc. Sorry but
that's no good way.

This all does not look very funny to me, as we defined the 'VW-guys' to
maintain the 'core'. It's not that we can discuss about structures and
methods to define and use the PF_CAN-stuff BUT changing the struct can_frame
and put structures in places where they do not belong is not a fine thing!

Also the file can_device.h should have been discussed on the mailing-list.
E.g. defining the can_sys_clock as an u8 is not a good idea. We have
sometimes really twisted timings, so u32 (in Hz) should be the right thing
here.

Please let us discuss these core things before starting any fight's on the
SVN ...

Btw. the idea for can_generic.c is ok. But we should ask if the name is
appropriate, as it contains generic things for can-drivers only and not for
the CAN itself. Maybe it should be named can_dev_gen.c or can_device.c or
something like this.

So please correct the can.h (repair the struct can_frame and move the
can_bittime-stuff to can_ioctl.h)

Nevertheless Urs and me have been on our internal fair he removed the
version.h stuff and is on the way to check these changes into the SVN.

Maybe Urs can repair the can.h as mentioned before and check in this current
stuff.

Andrey: Can you update the can_sys_clock to u32 in can_device.h?

Best regards,

Oliver (slightly displeased).
