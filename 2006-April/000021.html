Do you really need more than microsecond resolution on a low speed
communication bus like CAN, where even one bit has a transmission
time of 1 us and where a frame has 80+ bits?  And what is the use
of nanosecond timestamps when most of the kernel und user space 
timing functions have only microsecond granularity, but not even 
necessarily microsecond accuracy?

One call to recvfrom() is only one system call.  That's why I have
implemented the SO_TIMESTAMP socket option.  There is no need to
put such things into the can frame where they just do not belong.

</I>
I think we should not sacrify readability, maintainability and clean
design and interfaces for the sake of some microseconds before we don't
know we really need it.  That's a lesson software engineers have learned
over the last few decades:  Don't optimize anything for speed when there
is no problem with execution time.  If you really need faster execution
think about better algorithms, instead of hand optimizing for a particular
machine or compiler and instead of disturbing clean and simple interface
and clean code.  If that doesn't solve the problem, think again.  Only
if there is absolutely no way to solve the problem otherwise, you should
start giving up clean code and interfaces.
