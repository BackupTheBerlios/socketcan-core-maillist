Hi Peter,

thanks for the hint and the recommended fix.
Unfortunately i do not know the mscan driver nor the mscan specific 
behaviour to be able to ACK your patch and commit it to the SVN. 
Obviously this problem also exists in the branches/cannetdriver26 branch 
which is the current head of development for the CAN driver infrastructure.

&gt;<i> Just a (may be stupid) question: shouldn't there be any error frames for 
</I>&gt;<i> an error like a cable break ?? Or is this not supported by the mscan driver 
</I>&gt;<i> ?? 
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>
It's not supported by now. When you have a cable break (or even no 
corresponding CAN node) the controller should throw an error frame with 
CAN_ERR_BUSERROR set. This is currently done in interrupt service 
routine (isr) of the new SJA1000 driver, which floods the system with 
error frames, as the controller tries to send it's frame again and again 
until it is ack'ed. This is correct according to the spec but i does not 
make fun ... maybe we need some ratelimit-concept here.

But as the bus-error detection is not enabled nor handled in the mscan 
isr you don't see an appropriate error frame when the bus is not connected.

Best regards,
Oliver
