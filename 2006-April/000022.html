<PRE>Hi Jan,

i used the weekend to think on the current remarks on timestamps and
error-handling (which will i comment in the Error Handling thread).

1. resolution / timestamp-conversion-hell / low-performance-architectures

Let's start with CAN-basics: 
If you have a 1 MBit CAN each bit lasts about 1 usec. The shortest CAN-Frame
(11 bit ID, DLC=0) is 47 bits which is 47 usecs (+ frame intersection).
Additionally the CAN-bus is CSMA/CA with no real-time capabilities, so it's
really hard for me to understand, why anyone would need nano seconds?!?
Maybe the hero-engineer from Motorola used the nanosec resolution to debug
his chip-design but this timestamp resolution is definitely obsolete for CAN
users.

If you would like to use the timestamps from the mscan-controller, it would
be the correct way to devide the nanosecs by 1000 and add a (on-time
calculated) offset to the system clock and put his value directly into the
skb. That's really fast.

2. &quot;Two syscalls instead of one *pre-frame*&quot;

As i wrote before there is no need to have two systemcalls, e.g. when you
use recvmsg() to get the frames:

(..)
    on = 1;
    setsockopt(s, SOL_SOCKET, SO_TIMESTAMP, &amp;on, sizeof(on));
(..)
    iov.iov_base = &frame;
    iov.iov_len  = sizeof(struct can_frame);
(..)
    nbytes = recvmsg(s, &amp;msg, 0); /* error checking left out */
    cmsg = CMSG_FIRSTHDR(&amp;msg); /* enabled only one ctrl-msg */
    stamp = *(struct timeval*)CMSG_DATA(cmsg);

    if (stamp.tv_sec)
      printf(&quot;%d.%06d &quot;, stamp.tv_sec, stamp.tv_usec);
    if (frame.can_id &amp; CAN_EFF_FLAG)
      printf(&quot;%8X  &quot;, frame.can_id &amp; CAN_EFF_MASK);
    else
      printf(&quot;%3X  &quot;, frame.can_id &amp; CAN_SFF_MASK);
(..)

So if you only enable one control-message, it's easy like this. It does
everything you want and has only ONE syscall receiving a can_frame.

3. Conclusion

&gt;<i> Yes, but we should not start sacrificing efficiency for the sake of
</I>&gt;<i> style even before being asked for. I guess it's fairly easy to argue -
</I>&gt;<i> also on LKML - that one syscall is better than two if you need them
</I>&gt;<i> rather frequently. At least we should offer an alternative interface
</I>&gt;<i> aside the standard networking way for time-critical applications.
</I>
As you go through the source written by me, you will see, that my focus is
mostly on execution efficiency. But i can't see a real justification for
your kernel technique bypass solutions you want to be regarded here. This
solution is as fast as yours and it is like any other networking solution in
the Linux Kernel. Even in the Userspace. And i can't see any 'even more
time-critical applications' - do you?

The motivation to create the PF_CAN was indeed to break up with all the
useless and unstructured techniques that have been historically implemented
in the world of the 8-bit-controller-hackers (especially in the automotive
IT you can find really ugly implementations done by autodidactic engineers).

So i really do not want to reinvent the wheel, when bringing all the
necessary CAN-functionality to the user. Learn from the Standards is the
winnig method! Especially when it is a fast as other solutions ...

Greetings,

Oliver
