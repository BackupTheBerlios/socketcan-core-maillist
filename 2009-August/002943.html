Hi Maximilian,

i needed some time to ponder about your patch.

There are two assumptions in the patch that do not fit to the idea of a line
discipline and i was looking around in the internet and some code in the
Kernel that implements line disciplines.

You current approach implements some kind of flow control inside the ldisc as
you expect the incoming characters \r or \a are some kind of acknowledges for
the sent frames.

Indeed \r and \a are just skipped in the input stream.

The other thing is that you should better add a flag to sl-&gt;flags for the
binary encapsulation instead of creating a boolean value.

Please try to work with the tty as there were completely independent
i/o-streams to be processed by the ldisc and look into other implementations,
e.g.

<A HREF="http://lxr.linux.no/#linux+v2.6.30.5/drivers/net/irda/irtty-sir.c#L87">http://lxr.linux.no/#linux+v2.6.30.5/drivers/net/irda/irtty-sir.c#L87</A>

how the throttling of outgoing data is managed.

Maybe you should spend a hardware 'CTS' line for that or reduce the serial
bitrate so that your Atmel typically can cope with the data.

I don't have a good feeling creating a flow control mechanism (that's not even
ensured by e.g. some kind of sequence counter or whatever) inside the ldisc.

FWICS the ldisc generally knows about [en|de]capsualtion but let's the tty do
it's job to push the information to the device.

There is currently no concept how to recover the data stream with a special
token - which was pretty easy with the ASCII stuff. Maybe all the binary
information needs to be packed into bytes with bit 7 set and the binary values
 need to be split up into 7 bit chunks that are placed below bit 7, e.g.


t(0x74) 0x82 0xA3 0x80 for t1230, can_id 0x123, can_dlc 0, no data

instead of

t(0x74) 0x01 0x23 0x00

I'm sorry coming with a new idea now, but IMO the robustness of the protocol
is the basis for a reliable driver ...

We should spend some more thoughts on the protocol first.

Regards,
Oliver
