Will you post regular updates of the patch queue? Because if we start
working with your posted quilt stack, we'll follow exactly that way, and
it has to be made sure that follow-up patch stacks have to be consistent
with the first revision + additions.

&gt;<i> The creation of patches for different kernel versions is working very 
</I>&gt;<i> well and this looks like the major current use-case for me.
</I>
Well, I'm not interested in industrial sub-sub-communities who might
happen to have their internal requirements for old stuff. We go
mainline, and all that I care of is that no strange regressions occure
due to unclear patch handling workflows. It must be made sure that, if
somebody starts working with your last-posted patch queue and posts
follow-up patches, there is a well defined workflow which makes sure
that no things get lost over the process.

&gt;<i> The patches for the netdev ML are currently just *one* output path
</I>
Which will have to be updated with high pace if you want to go into the
mainline (at least if we assume that it doesn't go in on the first cut).

&gt;<i> Even if the stuff went into the mainline kernel, we should IMO support 
</I>&gt;<i> older kernels. That's not that big effort.
</I>
Well, that's covered by a PAL field :)
