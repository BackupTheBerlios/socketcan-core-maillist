Sooner than later the upstream maintainers would like to deal just with
*one* maintainer, I'm afraid. But we are not yet that far.

Ah, OK, I was not aware that Socket-CAN is now a after work job for you.

&gt;<i> For my work inside the CAN network-layer posting patches to Davem on the 
</I>&gt;<i> netdev-ML works perfectly fine. But for the ongoing activities i assume 
</I>&gt;<i> the major work to be done in the CAN _drivers_ section.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Even when the mail from Sam encouraged me a lot (thanks!), i would 
</I>&gt;<i> prefer someone else to set up a GIT tree (at kernel.org or at 
</I>&gt;<i> [pengutronix|linutronix|denx].de) to collect the CAN driver stuff, 
</I>&gt;<i> frequently re-base the tree and request git-pulls on the netdev-ML.
</I>
I already ask Wolfgang (Denk) and hosting the Socket-CAN-GIT-Repository
at DENX is possible. This would give use more flexibility in maintaining
the Socket-CAN code base.

&gt;<i> I hope i was able to make my motivation and my main focus transparent to 
</I>&gt;<i> you. And of course i'd like to stay the maintainer of the CAN 
</I>&gt;<i> network-layer stuff as described in linux/MAINTAINERS :-)
</I>
I understand your concerns.

Wolfgang.
