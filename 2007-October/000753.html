<PRE>Hi!

I already mentioned the can_sequence tool. It can be used a receiver, 
too. And there I face different error :(

(Our hardware is MPC5200 with mscan, can0 connected with can1. Kernel 
2.5.23-rc9-rt2.)

The scenario is that one program send as fast as is can CAN messages 
with an increasing number as payload. On the other side these messages 
are received and we look at the sequence number to see if a packet gets 
lost.

Indeed under certain circumstances some packages are lost. That might be 
okay, but the program is not informed by the kernel that some packages 
are dropped.


With the hacks mentioned in the other mail, I'm able to send a 100000 
packes back-to-back without loosing a message (on the sender side) or an 
ENOBUFS.

On the reciever side I look at the sequence numbers. When the programm 
just does a &quot;read(); analyse();&quot; loop everything is okay. But when it 
printf()s each message it receives, packages are _silently_ dropped.

It seems that with printf the processing time is drematically increased 
and the queue receive queue (from the packet scheduler to the 
application) overflows.

I don't have a problem with this, but I want be to informed of that 
issue. In netlink we have the same problem, and the app gets a ENOBUFS 
on read() if the queue overflows.

Again: How has rtcan solved this problem?

regards - Marc
