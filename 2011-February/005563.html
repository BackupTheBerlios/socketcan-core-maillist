Oh, the good old days :-)

Ok. But i think we could leave it as-is. I don't think it's worth to break the
definition here.

&gt;&gt;<i> Logically this is redundant to the bitvalue in CAN_ERR_PROT_ACK

&gt;&gt;<i> Yes. From the current point of view they are. I thought a CAN_ERR_BUSERROR

That's probably too much. 8-)
I think when CAN_ERR_PROT is set, looking into data[2] is pretty ok.

But in general the idea was to have error and status information in the CAN-ID
for easy access &amp; easy filtering - and give additional problem information in
the data[] fields.

For that reason i would prefer to have the CAN_ERR_ACTIVE bit *only* in the
CAN-ID status bits and not in the detailed data[1] (CAN_ERR_CTRL_ACTIVE) as
you and Kurt suggested.

&gt;<i> We then could or even should add a version information into the error
</I>&gt;<i> message. I think data[5] could be used for that purpose.
</I>
It's like having the CAN core version information where Dave was complaining
when it gone Mainline. Who should check version numbers and maintain all this?

Better we do a final cleanup and then it's done.

IMO this patch would be enough:

Ok, the bits

    CAN_ERR_ACK(can_id) and CAN_ERR_PROT_ACK(data[2])

are set together. But who cares?

CAN_ERR_BUSERROR(can_id) could be defined as the or-ed value from

    (CAN_ERR_LOSTARB | CAN_ERR_PROT | CAN_ERR_CRTL)

That looks consistent to me after all the discussions.

Oliver
