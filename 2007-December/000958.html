&gt;<i> Hello,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> we already started to discuss how and when to start, stop and re-start
</I>&gt;<i> the CAN controller, which is the next point on the TO-DO list. The
</I>&gt;<i> controller is started with &quot;ifconfig up&quot; and &quot;down&quot;. This is the
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;adminisstrative&quot; start/stop. If it cannot send or receive data, e.g.
</I>&gt;<i> due to bus-off, netdev_carrier_off() should be called. After automatic
</I>&gt;<i> or manual re-start and recovery, netdev_carrier_on() should be called.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I would like to implement the automatic re-start in &quot;dev.c&quot; to make it
</I>&gt;<i> available to all drivers by calling an exported  function, e.g.
</I>&gt;<i> can_bus_off(). This function will then call netdev_carrier_off() and
</I>&gt;<i> setup a timer if &quot;restart_ms &gt; 0&quot;, which will trigger recovery when
</I>&gt;<i> the timer elapses and call do_set_mode(CAN_MODE_START) and
</I>&gt;<i> netdev_carrier_off(). Manual recover is possible with &quot;echo start
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;sys/class/net/can_mode&quot;. Are there any side effects or problems with
</I>&gt;<i> pending TX messages or local &quot;echo&quot;?
</I>
I can only talk about the at91_can driver, but this might apply to
other drivers as well: A TX message is written to a &quot;mailbox&quot;, which is
actually a piece of hardware with a few registers. After that, you
cannot really control it anymore. The hardware will try to send it and
will notify you if this is done. In a bus-off event, I could check my
TX mailboxes for unsent messages, read them back, and try to send them
later after recovery. Problem is that I cannot know if this is desired
or not. There might be messages that are not valid anymore after a few
hundred milliseconds have gone by.

In the at91 driver, all messages that were not completely sent at the
moment of a device stop or bus-off are lost. There's no way for
userspace to know which of the last packets were actually sent. I have
8 TX mailboxes, so up to 8 messages could still hang in the buffer.

I'm afraid this behaviour is all we can get in a sane way. So it's up
to userspace applications to decide what they want to send again after
a bus-off. Drivers should never try to guess what users may want ;-) 

Thanks,
Hans
