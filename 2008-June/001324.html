True.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 2. There is no reason good to put bitrate specialized calculations into 
</I>&gt;<i> kernel source (and maybe different algos for different controllers and 
</I>&gt;<i> different user opinions).
</I>
I disagree. &quot;bitrate&quot; is an important property of every CAN driver, and
knowing how to set it properly is definetly the drivers task. Maybe its
most important task, as the rest is quite trivial.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I want to beware all of us to have these algo discussions on netdev-ML. 
</I>&gt;<i> And things that could be handled easily with a userspace tool should

</I>
I agree, but only in a hardware-independent way. Calculating register
values in userspace is a no-go. From a userspace app we want to open a
socket and configure the bitrate without having to care about what chip
is behind it. If that were not possible, we would lose much of the
advantages of having PF_CAN in the networking core.

&gt;<i> So all the specialists out there can 
</I>&gt;<i> have fun with their specific homebrew and tuned bitrate algos.
</I>
Yes, but only with hardware independent attributes like the ones listed
above.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Btw. we decided to implement a 'non-expert' bitrate calculation for 
</I>&gt;<i> non-expert users. But not all the prop_seg stuff ...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So you just have
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> [1] simple bitrate calculation (maybe overruled by bitrate tables that 
</I>&gt;<i> are compiled-in or set at runtime)
</I>&gt;<i> [2] btreg settings (for specialists)
</I>
What do I do in at91_can? I don't have btr0 or btr1. Do you really want
to export chip specific registers through sysfs? Then we will see loads
of userspace programs that only work with certain chips (similar to good
old DOS times when printer drivers were compiled into the application).

We could avoid that problem by putting bitrate calculation stuff into a
userspace library, but then this lib has to be maintained to be in sync
with kernel development, and we run into kernel vs. library version problems.

I vote for doing this in the driver and keep the interface to userspace
completely hardware independent.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It would be nice if you could just go to the appropriate discussion in 
</I>&gt;<i> the mailinglist archive.
</I>
I didn't ;-) I missed parts of that discussion at the time, sorry if I
repeated stuff that was already discussed.

Thanks,
hjk
