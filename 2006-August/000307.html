</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The idea is to integrate the CAN as a protocol family - next to protocol

</I>
I agree with well integrated solution and its advantages.
But I cannot agree with significant performance compromise
and I would be unhappy, if such problems would block
use for control applications which is an original area CAN has been
designed for. CAN is utilized and sometime abused for many different
purposes now. But original goal should be kept in mind.
I am not big fan of pushing as much as possible parts into
RT-Linux, RTAI or Xenomai double kernels. Only really fast things
belongs there. Standard 2.6.x Linux kernel has reasonably good (O(1))
scheduler and many RT processes of applications can be written as small
statically linked code locked into memory. There are some results,
that fully preemptive kernel can guarantee maximal latencies for
highest priority task about 20 usec. I would be more pessimistic
for now and I would expect, that 100-500 usec should not be problem
on many hardware setups in short while. But it is enough to ensure
correct trajectory planning for many robotic systems where 1 msec
is used in many cases. The jitter &lt; 500ms is not problem, because
CANopen process data confirmation can be synchronized by SYNC
message provided from some dedicated node for example.
It would be significant lost if the proposed solution would not
aim to provide t least suitable latencioes for such setup.
I agree, that regular kernel would not be enough for software
implemented TT CAN and similar protocols, but for usual control
tasks there should not be real problem if priority of IRQ
worker threads and RT tasks are defined well and there
is no blocker of messages flow. I have looked at Socket-CAN
and I see possibility of such problem there at this moment.
But I think, that it should be possible to overcome it
if per device queues are supported by Linux networking core.
Actual solution has another drawback, that CAN messages can be
reordered on SMP system if chip IRQ alters between
CPUs. The utilization of such system for CANopen
block transfers (as an example) is many times more
difficult (requires sorting according to timestamps),
than if order is naturally preserved.

&gt;<i> As Jan was not sure if the Linux-networklayer can be driven correctly in
</I>&gt;<i> RT-environments, the Socket-API was discussed and confirmed as common
</I>&gt;<i> sense between the 'normal' world and the RT-world. On this Socket-API
</I>&gt;<i> flavour the RT-Socket-CAN was implemented using other techniques than
</I>&gt;<i> the Linux-networklayer to meet the RT-requirements (e.g. with
</I>&gt;<i> homemade-FIFOs instead of the standard-networklayer queueing).
</I>
I agree if this would not kill the area, where we and many
others like/need to use Linux CAN based systems.

&gt;<i> So from my opinion the ideas and solutions have been worked out very
</I>&gt;<i> clearly in the discussion and we are now at the point to discuss about
</I>&gt;<i> new CAN-protocols (within the PF_CAN) and how to realize the additional
</I>&gt;<i> requirements of some CAN-users with a standard-network-driver-interface
</I>&gt;<i> approach.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> E.g. if you like to send a sequence of can_frames we should discuss
</I>&gt;<i> about creating some kind of CAN_RAWSEQ protocol that allows to send
</I>&gt;<i> multiple frames at one syscall, or maybe we can just send multiple
</I>&gt;<i> CAN-Frames on the CAN_RAW-socket (which would be splitted up inside the
</I>&gt;<i> RAW-socket). On the other hand regarding the network-interface for
</I>&gt;<i> CAN-controllers there might be a discussion on CAN-drivers that create
</I>&gt;<i> more than one netdevice for one controller to meet the
</I>&gt;<i> hardware-mailbox-filter-whatever-mechanism.
</I>
I think, that raw socket handling should be fast enough to
process messages one by one, but syscall overhead is not
so small, so I would vote for write/send/read/receive
to raw message to be able pass more messages on
one call to the kernel and then fill them into more
SKBs.

&gt;<i> So in my opinion RT-Socket-CAN and Socket-CAN (aka LLCF) address in some
</I>&gt;<i> cases different problems and solve it with different techniques under
</I>&gt;<i> one (mostly) common Socket-API. This makes this discussion that important.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As Wolfgang stated in this thread some RT-implementations (e.g.
</I>&gt;<i> CAN-drivers) are 'lighter' to meet latency issues and implementing some
</I>&gt;<i> kind of 'TX-queues-with-reordering' looks definitely like a task for
</I>&gt;<i> RT-Socket-CAN.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I would suggest Pavel making some steps of testing with the 'standard'
</I>&gt;<i> socket-can to get a feeling of the IT-flavour from socket-can. On the
</I>&gt;<i> other hand i will look through the latest code from Wolfgang where Jan
</I>&gt;<i> posted the Link to.

</I>This is good for some application controlled access protocols,
but again, I am not sure about control tasks.
Typical demand is to sent 6 messages to 6 distributed servos
at each sample time instance.
The most logical thing is to compute data and send them into
nonblocking CAN interface through one call. On the other hand,
I agree, that there could be some problem to deal with overload
in such case.

We are preparing test setup and we have already compiled Socket-CAN
trunk for 2.6.17.6 + RT8. There is slight problem, that socket-can
uses Linux 2.6 deprecated module parameters constructs in some
drivers which are no longer available in 2.6.17 kernels.
I am sending patch solving this problem. It is compatible with
all 2.6.10+ kernels. The older 2.6.x kernels has different
parameters for module_param_array() macro.

We need to prepare board support for cards which we have
on test system and we try to run some tests during next weeks.

Best wishes

             Pavel
