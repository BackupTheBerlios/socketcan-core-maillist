Have you ever checked the tools in trunk/can-utils/* ?

The tool 'cangen' is a CAN traffic generator that might also fit your needs.

&gt;<i> It opens a PF_CAN socket and sends packets (with increasing packet 
</I>&gt;<i> numbers inside) as fast as it can. After a few seconds a write fails 
</I>&gt;<i> with an errno of ENOBUFS &quot;No buffer space available&quot;. What the userspace 
</I>&gt;<i> does is to generate packages faster than they could be delivered.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We at pengutronix think this is an inappropriate behaviour. From 
</I>&gt;<i> connection orriented protocols (yes I know, CAN is different) like 
</I>&gt;<i> TCP/IP I get an EWOULDBLOCK/EAGAIN if the sender runs out of buffers or 
</I>&gt;<i> it comes to congestions in the &quot;connection&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I would appreciate that CAN behaves in a similar manner. A propper 
</I>&gt;<i> solution would also include the possibility to select/poll on a 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;congested&quot; socket till it is free again.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I've looked through the code a bit and AFAICS the ENOBUFS comes from here:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> a) net/can/raw.c:raw_sendmsg()
</I>&gt;<i>     allocs a skb with skb_alloc() and calls finally can_send()
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> b) net/can/af_can.c:can_send()
</I>&gt;<i>     calls dev_queue_xmit()
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> c) net/core/dev.c:dev_queue_xmit()
</I>&gt;<i>     tries to add skb to the device's queue
</I>&gt;<i>     returns a &quot;NET_XMIT_DROP&quot; when the txqueue of the device is full
</I>&gt;<i>     (the skb is really lost in that case)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> d) net/can/af_can.c:can_send()
</I>&gt;<i>     converts NET_XMIT_DROP to -ENOBUFS
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> e) -ENOBUFS is finally returned into userspace
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In order to work around this problem we have added rather hackish patch 
</I>&gt;<i> to our BSP. It consists of two parts:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1) In the write/sendmsg codepath: net/can/raw.c:raw_sendmsg(), replace
</I>&gt;<i>     the allocation of the skb &quot;alloc_skb()&quot; with &quot;sock_alloc_send_skb()&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>     (see attached patch)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2) set the txqueuelen of a can device to 10000
</I>&gt;<i>     (via ifconfig during runtime)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This brings the following changes:
</I>&gt;<i> - The skb's memory comes from the socket
</I>&gt;<i> - The sockets memory buffer will run empty if the packets can't be
</I>&gt;<i>    transmitted and thus freed
</I>&gt;<i> - sock_alloc_send_skb() will block in this case
</I>&gt;<i>    (maybe even return EGAIN/EWOULDBLOCK in case of a nonblocking socket,
</I>&gt;<i>     but I havn't tested that)
</I>&gt;<i> - last but not least, if only one socket is involed, the sockets memory
</I>&gt;<i>    pool runs out _before_ the txqueue of then device runs over
</I>&gt;<i>    But you have a per socket memory pool, which means that the more
</I>&gt;<i>    sockets you have, the more skb have to be queued before the memory is
</I>&gt;<i>    out. So we can calculate when then txqueuelen of 10000 isn't long
</I>&gt;<i>    enough.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As I said before, this is rather hackish. I prefer a clean solution.
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>
Me too :-)

Having a feedback like a blocking write looks like a reasonable idea.
But your approach deals with per-socket buffers and heavily increases 
device buffers. This indeed does not solve the problem and surely won't 
find any friends on netdev ML ;-)

Maybe returning EAGAIN makes more sense in *this* special case of queue 
overflow in the netdevice than returning ENOBUF. And IMO the socket 
should support blocking write.

But in any case we should deal directly with the netdevice buffers and 
not with socketbuffers, where you don't know what happens if numerous 
apps open numerous sockets and create heavy load.

Currently the behaviour is very transparent: When the netdev is not able 
to cope with all the data you get an ENOBUF as error. When the socket 
additionally would support a blocking write the behaviour would still be 
transparent to me. So it could be your idea of using 
sock_alloc_send_skb() BUT with a socket memory buffer queue len of 1.

Anyway thanks for this discussion. I discovered this problem myself when 
i replayed a logfile with the 'canplayer' and i also increased the tx 
queue len (sigh). This was hackish too. I also detected the need for 
using the shadow tx buffers in the CAN controller to get the maximum tx 
load. But all this does not solve the general problem that can always 
occur with several sockets generating high network load.

&gt;<i> Please don't say: &quot;CAN is an unreliable protocol anyway, so it doesn't 
</I>&gt;<i> matter if the packages are dropped in the kernel.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>
I never would ;-)

Oliver
