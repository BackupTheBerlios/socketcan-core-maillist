Hi Wolfgang,

i updated some kernel version dependent parts in the branch, so that is
compiles with the upcoming 2.6.31 kernel.

But i did not touch the at91 and mscan as i did not have a cross compile
environment on my system.

The changes make it possible to create patches with strip-src that are
comparable with the mainlined sources.


&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Do you know how far in kernel history the netlink interface works?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Currently I use:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> #if LINUX_VERSION_CODE &lt; KERNEL_VERSION(2,6,24) || defined(CONFIG_CAN_DEV_SYSFS)
</I>&gt;<i> #define USE_CAN_DEV_SYSFS
</I>&gt;<i> #endif
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> from vcan.c, but I have to check more carefully.
</I>
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> If it's since e.g. 2.6.18, i would suggest to make a cut there and only
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> support 2.6.18+ and netlink on the SocketCAN SVN trunk.
</I>
I think it's much older but i did not check this on my own so far ...

Regards,
Oliver
