<PRE>Hello,

The bit timing discussion has been paused for the last week. Just want
to refresh it and preach for the bit timing table  :)
First to summarize as I see it.
We all have agreed that an expert method of setting the bit timings
using hardware independent method is needed. The following parameters
are required to specify bit rate (according to ISO 11898-1):

time quanta (ns)
syncronisation segment
propagation segment
phase segment 1
phase segment 2

This parameters are set over the sysfs over the entries like
&lt;sysfs&gt;/btr_tq
&lt;sysfs&gt;/btr_syncseg
&lt;sysfs&gt;/btr_propseg
&lt;sysfs&gt;/btr_phseg1
&lt;sysfs&gt;/btr_phseg2

The CAN driver calculates the BTR registers using btr_* values, which is
normally just very trivial.
The bit rate is set on setting the interface up, so no additional
measures to provide the atomic access are required.
The additional entry &lt;sysfs&gt;/bitrate is implemented to read the actual
bit rate.

Example of an use case:

ifconfig can0 down
echo &quot;500&quot; &gt; &lt;sysfs_can0&gt;/btr_tq
echo &quot;1&quot; &gt; &lt;sysfs_can0&gt;/btr_syncseg
echo &quot;11&quot; &gt; &lt;sysfs_can0&gt;/btr_propseg
echo &quot;2&quot; &gt; &lt;sysfs_can0&gt;/btr_phseg1
echo &quot;2&quot; &gt; &lt;sysfs_can0&gt;/btr_phseg2
ifconfig cano up

cat &lt;sysfs_can0&gt;/bitrate
125000


This values will work for setting 125Kbit on any CAN HW using &quot;good&quot;
clock for the CAN controller (8, 16 MHz). You will get a problem and
will have to find out another values if using CAN clock like 33 MHz etc.
But it will work, and we have no need to map HW registers.

The second part of the discussion was to provide for the normal user the
easy possibility to set standard CiA values, which are used in 95% of
cases. Definitely a good idea. 
The original idea was to use an algorithm implemented in the driver for
calculating the bit timing registers for the provided value. This
approach even allows to set not only CiA values, but any which can be
calculated by the algorithm.

This approach works as long as algorithm works. It do works for SJA1000,
but what about another CAN controllers? OK, let assume we will get that
method work on any CAN controller we need, but I still see following
contras:

- Extra effort to support this code on different CAN controllers
- Pretty complex untrivial code in the HW driver. This code have nothing
to do with control of driver specific HW itself.
- Each time I select any standard bit rate the calculating algorithm
uses the same input values and calculate the same output values. Each
time I select 125Kbit for my HW the same register values will be
calculated. So why calculating each time? I can calculate it ones and
use each time the same constants. It is like each time I need pi to
calculate it instead of using 3,14.
- Using that approach not only standard values may be set, but for this
we already have &quot;proper&quot; HW independent approach. Why duplication
features?

That is why the idea with bit rate tables came up. Instead of
calculating the bit rate on runtime each time we select it, we calculate
the table of required bit rates once and than use that constants.

Which mechanism to use for defining the table (special sysfs entries or
ifconfig, or even icanconfig (analog to iwconfig)) is a discussion
point. For me is important to use the same HW independant values we use
in &quot;expert&quot; mode.

The bit rate calculation algorithm may be implemented in user space and
generate values not as HW specific register values, but as tq, propseg
etc. By this we can achieve having only one implementation of the bit
rate calculating code which fits all CAN HW.

Regards,
Vladislav
