<PRE>Hi,
&gt;<i> I'm not familiar with kfifo structure, and I didn't like it because there need a spin_lock to use it.
</I>
It seems that you don't need to use your own kfifo. Socket-CAN core has
it's internal queues, you only have to fit in this infrastructure.

&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; Daniel,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; We're anxious to integrate those codes now. Perhaps it'll take us quite a long
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> time to use kfifo. How about implementing it with the next version?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> See above. What do you mean with the next version. The driver posted by
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Masayuki is far away from being accepted as it does not yet comply with
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the Socket-CAN driver API, to say the least.
</I>&gt;<i> I've few experience on CAN driver and it's also the first time for OKI-san to write Can driver. Would you please give us a reference and we'll follow it up. We only read 'can.txt' from kernel document. Thank you for your help in advance.
</I>
Oliver's email should be your starting point. Read the code from net/can and see
how other drivers are built.

As I previously said I'm interested in writing a driver for CAN
EP80579 controller,
but the start is pretty slow. Since your controller seems to be pretty
similar we
can do some things in common.

I can help you, if you send me a pointer to your CAN controller
datasheet + eventually
grant me access to your repo.

thanks,
Daniel.
