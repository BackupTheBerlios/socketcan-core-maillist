<PRE>Hi Yegor,

&gt;<i> Yes, these were my last changes. Unfortunately Wolfgang didn't comment them. 
</I>
Okay, then we should wait until he is back.

&gt;<i> As far as I understand we've two issues:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1. review non-standard error counting and statistics: I removed non used code as Wolfgang asked, but we should introduce this such a counting along with the priv-&gt;can.can_state one. See sja1000 for reference. What do you think about it?
</I>
I haven't read the whole discussion about this issue up to now. But I think
there should be an error counter and it should not stop at 256 :) I need to
read a bit more to decide if the hardware counters could be useful.

&gt;<i> 2. bus-off handling: I still didn't manage to clear with Wolfgang, what is exactly to be done with this stuff.
</I>
Okay, looks we need to wait for Wolfgang here as well.

&gt;<i> Which one would you like to accomplish?
</I>
Glimpsing through the code, I got the idea to check the remaining FIXMEs in the
source itself. I want to check if they are already mentioned in known_issues,
can be postponed, or have been overlooked so far. Especially the naked BUG()
lines won't make it upstream, I'd guess ;)

&gt;<i> Could you get the git-version of iproute2 running? Otherwise we'll have to test the stuff with SysFS.
</I>
Dunno if it is the latest git, but I have a version running here. I compiled it
using ptxdist, which uses the latest tarball and a set of patches (which prolly
come from upstream-git). Will check if we have an additional bugfix pending.

Regards,

   Wolfram
