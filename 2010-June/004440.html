Before we continue, we should address the fact that we now have two versions
of the driver. It doesn't make sense to work on both.
Just for the record, I knew that Marc was working on this, and offered
cooperation in a private mail a few weeks ago. He never answered, so I made
it work myself, and posted it as soon as I could. A few hours after he saw
that, he came up with his version...

So, instead of continuing wasting engineering powers, you should decide
which of the two versions is in the better shape already, and we continue
working on that. I don't mind at all if you choose Marc's version. I'm
not running after copyright lines, I just want to see flexcan in mainline
as soon as possible.

Thanks,
Hans
