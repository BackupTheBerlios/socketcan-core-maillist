Thanks for your request. I also took a look on the current Linux Softing 
driver and made it running under 'current' kernels newer than 2.6.12, i 
think. (do you already have a patch for that?)

But i did not start to rework the driver for netdevice support as i got 
somehow confused due to the dpram connection and the integrated 
intelligence of the card.

&gt;<i> This card is not a regular CAN chip, it has a micocontroller (with CAN

</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>
But this feedback from the card is pretty fine.

The loopback process work like this:

- CAN driver get's a skb with a struct can_frame (in the skb-data section)
- put the CAN frame into the controller and start the transmission
- save the CAN frame to loopback the frame on successful transmission
( wait for end of transmission =&gt; TX ok interrupt)
- at tx interrupt get the saved skb and push it to the receive queue

That's all.

The idea is to 'echo' only CAN frames that touched the CAN bus properly 
(and with a correct timestamp that varies due to the arbitration process).
So when you get an error from your card and the CAN frame could not be 
sent, you can discard (==free) the (saved) skbuff containing the 
outgoing CAN frame.

Did the idea behind the interface flag IFF_ECHO become more clearly to you?

If you could not provide the information about the correctly sent frames 
and therefore could not provide a proper loopback handling on driver 
level, you must not set the IFF_ECHO flag (this makes the CAN 
networklayer do the loopback but without timestamp accuracy).

Regards,
Oliver
