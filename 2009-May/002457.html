<PRE>Hello,

here comes my first version of the reviced Socket-CAN patches
presented on the netdev ML some time ago, see:

  <A HREF="http://marc.info/?l=linux-netdev&amp;m=123507025810612&amp;w=4.">http://marc.info/?l=linux-netdev&amp;m=123507025810612&amp;w=4.</A>

Before I sent out v2 of the patch series, I want them to be reviewed
and tested by the Socket-CAN community. Here are the major changes:

- The SysFS interface has been replaced by the Netlink interface.
  See chapter 6.5 of &quot;Documentation/networking/can.txt&quot; and
  &quot;include/linux/can/netdev.h&quot; for further information. The patch
  for the &quot;ip&quot; programm of the IPROUTE2 utility suite will be
  provided separately.

- For the netlink interface, the &quot;clock&quot; is now available again
  via &quot;struct can_bittiming_const&quot;.

- The restart function is now protected by &quot;dev-&gt;tx_lock&quot; using the
  &quot;netif_tx_[lock|unlock]&quot; functions.

- For the  restart, the device driver must now handle CAN_MODE_STOP
  as well, apart from CAN_MODE_START to avoid race conditions.

- The &quot;irq_lock&quot; member of &quot;struct can_priv&quot; has been removed. I do
  not see a  need for it. If CAN device drivers need extra locking,
  they should provide it privately.

- The unused do_[s|g]et_ctrlmode member of &quot;struct can_priv&quot; has
  been removed.

- &quot;const&quot; has been added to &quot;struct net_device&quot; for some functions
  not allowed to touch that structure.

- The library functions &quot;can_set_bittiming&quot; and &quot;can_close_cleanup&quot;
  have been renamed to the more general names &quot;open_candev&quot; and
  &quot;close_candev&quot;, respectively.

- Use &quot;del_timer_sync&quot; instead of &quot;del_timer&quot; for the  re-start timer.

- The macro &quot;ND2D()&quot; has been replaced by &quot;dev-&gt;dev.parent&quot; as it
  does not make the code more readable.

- Various other minor correction as reported on the netdev ML.

The restart function still needs some more protection (locking),
I think, but apart from that, the new version looks already quite
good to me.
My plan is to first get these patches in and then we can think about
a migration of the Socket-CAN SVN trunk code to using netlink.

Please test and comment.

Thanks

Wolfgang.
