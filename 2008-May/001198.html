OK.

&gt;<i> But i don't have any objections to change this process for the CAN

Yes, rebasing should be rather trivial and the users would benefit as well.

&gt;<i> And if we should keep the SVN source of mainlined drivers up-to-date is

</I>
I think it's still usful for compatibility with older 2.6 kernels.

This rises the question where to host the Socket-CAN-GIT repository.

Wolfgang.
