A &quot;Signed-off&quot; imply that you are in the chain of people from the
initial author to the final committer.
If I understood this correct you have tested the patch - this is often documented
by the tag:

Tested-by:

If you also reviewed the patch this is documented by the tag:

Reviewed-by:


Say for example that I create a patch to a can driver.
Then the patch will have me as author and I will add my
&quot;Signed-off-by:&quot; too.
Then I pass it on to Oliver.
He see the patch but acknowledge this is for Wolfgang to handle.
So Oliver add a &quot;Signed-off-by:&quot; and pass it on to Wolfgang.
Then you in parallel picj up the patch and test it.
Wolfgang see you doing so so he adds a &quot;Tested-by:&quot; tag.
Wolfgang then maybe fix up a few trivialities and apply it.
Then he add hes Signed-off-by.

So the resulting patch would look like this:

From: Sam ...

Body of changelog...

Signed-off-by: Sam ...
Signed-off-by: Oliver ...
Tested-by: Sebastian ...
Signed-off-by: Wolfgang ...

This is a very likely scenario and if you look at the kernel changelogs you
will see this happen a lot of times.

But the main message is that a &quot;Signed-off-by:&quot; is used by the patch of
people handling a patch - and we have other tags for the other
sort of contributions.
