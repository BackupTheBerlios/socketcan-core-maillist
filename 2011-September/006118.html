</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1) The CAN needs fast local roundrip time for correct operation

</I>&gt;<i> The time is sum of propagation from CAN controller chip,
</I>&gt;<i> propagation delay of optocoupler or other galvanic isolation,

</I>&gt;<i> Rx filtering and Rx,Tx logic level comparator.
</I>&gt;<i> Iw we count necessity to synchronize this between multiple
</I>&gt;<i> CAN nodes then whole roundtrip time has to be smaller than
</I>&gt;<i> 50-80% of single bit bit time quantum.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 2) From the noise and stabilization of voltage on the wire
</I>&gt;<i> the sampling point should be in the middle of bit pulse
</I>&gt;<i> delayed by round-trip delay from 1. This is 50% of bit
</I>&gt;<i> time (i.e. dependent on bitrate) + round trip delay (dependent
</I>&gt;<i> on delay in controller and concrete board circuitry).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 3) But sampling point has to allow to decide about collision
</I>&gt;<i> before next bit Tx is started =&gt; it cannot be moved after
</I>&gt;<i> end of the given Tx bit time interval.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 4) It is necessary to synchronize bit timing in all
</I>&gt;<i> CAN controllers during arbitration (ID sending) phase.
</I>&gt;<i> The first sync is done after receiving of the first
</I>&gt;<i> edge on the wire. It can be other node start of Tx
</I>&gt;<i> or our own Tx dominant level. Controller shifts its Tx
</I>&gt;<i> timing such way, that start of the next Tx bit interval
</I>&gt;<i> should result in Rx transition at the end the sensed
</I>&gt;<i> Rx bit. I.e. it counts only TSEG2 til next bit start.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 5) There are some more things to consider if triple
</I>&gt;<i> sampling and filtering is enabled to suppress noise
</I>&gt;<i> on wire. It can be used only, if time quantum clocks
</I>&gt;<i> are fast enough to fit this sampling interval between
</I>&gt;<i> stabilization of delayed Rx logic level and end of Tx bit
</I>&gt;<i> time interval.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 6) If the clock frequencies of all nodes CAN controllers
</I>&gt;<i> are guaranteed to be same, then no more synchronization
</I>&gt;<i> is necessary during message Tx/Rx (SJW=0). But that assumption
</I>&gt;<i> does not hold. That is why bitstuffing is used and guarantees
</I>&gt;<i> that there is at least one logic level transition (edge)
</I>&gt;<i> after each 6 bit time. If there is zero roundtrip propagation
</I>&gt;<i> delay and sampling in 50% of bit time interval then
</I>&gt;<i> maximal skew/frequency difference of the clocks could be
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>   (1+1/6*50%) - 1 i.e. 8%
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This means, that SJW bigger than 8% of whole bit time
</I>&gt;<i> would not help to synchronize bitrate difference, because
</I>&gt;<i> for such case setup cannot work anyway. Propagation delay
</I>&gt;<i> is not zero then there is even less time left for sampling
</I>&gt;<i> point shift which would not cause incorrect bit data
</I>&gt;<i> detection so reasonable maximum is probably lower.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I expect that for reasonable precise setup of bitrate
</I>&gt;<i> when exact ratio is found and crystal based oscillators
</I>&gt;<i> there is the best option small SJW i.e. 1 or for very
</I>&gt;<i> fast TQ clock equivalent of 1% - 2% of bittime.
</I>&gt;<i> For nonexact ratio or low quality clocks sources,
</I>&gt;<i> bigger SJW values make sense. But big value has other
</I>&gt;<i> disadvantage. If there is bigger jitter in Tx/Rx delays
</I>&gt;<i> or clocks then it is propagated back to bit timing
</I>&gt;<i> and stability of system composed from multiple nodes
</I>&gt;<i> could be questionable. There is even bigger interval
</I>&gt;<i> where noise pulse could cause lost of the synchronization.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> On base of above analysis, I think that blindly set SJW
</I>&gt;<i> on maximum is not good idea. It should be at least limited
</I>&gt;<i> to 5% of bit time. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Because bit timing calculation is not what everybody
</I>&gt;<i> want to do again and again, the actual code tries
</I>&gt;<i> to hide differences of CAN controllers and provide
</I>&gt;<i> at least partially understandable knobs to user
</I>&gt;<i> with parameters independent on concrete setup low level
</I>&gt;<i> details to allow set bitrate for usual Joe user.
</I>&gt;<i> The basic parameters are chosen such way, that user need
</I>&gt;<i> not to care about actual TQ clock and selecting prescaller,
</I>&gt;<i> that is why sampling point is in percent of bittime.
</I>&gt;<i> SJW is more problematic, but may it be use of 2 or 5%
</I>&gt;<i> of bittime by default with assurance that zero is
</I>&gt;<i> replaced by one, would serve to most people pleasure.
</I>&gt;<i> May it be, that 0.1 of percent should be used as unit
</I>&gt;<i> for external parameter too.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I hope that actual calculation works reasonably well.
</I>&gt;<i> But if it should be enhanced, then it would worth
</I>&gt;<i> to add additional parameter except crystal/controller
</I>&gt;<i> clock source freqency to the concrete boards drivers.
</I>&gt;<i> It should be measured round-trip delay of given/used
</I>&gt;<i> transceiver/optocouplers combination. This would
</I>&gt;<i> allow to have sampling point setup yet more independent
</I>&gt;<i> on given HW and same value could be used for different
</I>&gt;<i> bitrates. But there is still unknown parameter
</I>&gt;<i> capacity/length of connected wires so there is still
</I>&gt;<i> something left to user consideration.
</I>
Thanks for your detailed explanation. It clearly shows that adjusting
SJW is non-trivial and nothing a normal CAN user should deal with. When
adjusting SJW, do you also need to tweek other bit-timing parameters,
e.g. tq? I mean, would &quot;ip link set can0 type can bitrate x
sampling-point y sjw z&quot; work for your setup or do you need to use the
expert mode setting via &quot;ip link set can0 type can tq ...&quot; anyway?

Wolfgang.
