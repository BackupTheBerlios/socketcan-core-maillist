Hi Wolfgang,

i checked the availability of the needed netlink functionalities in older
kernels. Indeed 2.6.23 contains the needed APIs but the Kbuild environment
supports something like &quot;ccflags-$(CONFIG_CAN_DEV_SYSFS)&quot; only since 2.6.24 so
your selection was pretty good :-)

Additionally i meditated on my 'ugly, cumbersome and difficult to maintain'
changes for a long time this night.

I'm also not happy with the modifications, but i can tell that this kind of
coding style makes the maintenance quite easy as you can directly compare the
current mainline source code to the SVN code.

I usually use the graphical mgdiff to compare the mainline code to the SVN
code, e.g. with

mgdiff net-next-2.6/drivers/net/can/dev.c \
socketcan/branches/netlink/kernel/2.6/drivers/net/can/dev.c

and i can identify the KERNEL_VERSION depended stuff and *real* differences
pretty well.

E.g. the difference of open_candev() is EXPORT_SYMBOL() in mainline and
EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL() in the SVN ... ;-)

Please give mgdiff a try with the files mentioned above.

The changes in commit 980 make the identification of these differences much
easier so that only the yellow lines (in mgdiff) should be investigated more
seriously.

Supporting old stuff is laborious but i found a quite handy way in the last
three years to port the things back to the SVN so that users with a 2.6.16 can
run the latest(!) PF_CAN network layer code.

Regarding the backward compatibility with each individual CAN driver, i would
suggest the individual driver maintainers to decide and document the backward
compatibility, e.g. with

#if LINUX_VERSION_CODE &lt; KERNEL_VERSION(2,6,21)
#error This driver does not support Kernel versions &lt; 2.6.21
#endif

in the SVN drivers code.

E.g. the sja1000_platform.c does currently not compile with a 2.6.24 which
should be documented.

I won't say that every driver should support (very) old kernels but we need
some kind of this documentation users can trust on - and probably send patches
if someone adapted the code to older kernels. This makes also clear if anyone
really needs the old stuff.

Regards,
Oliver
