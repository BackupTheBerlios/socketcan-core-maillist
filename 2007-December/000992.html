</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> the more i thought about the specific 'additional' features of some

</I>&gt;<i> into the wrong direction.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Comparing to Ethernet devices and remembering the (simple) netdevice

</I>&gt;<i> offer and NOT how to integrate all the (grown) mechanics implemented

</I>
Hi Oliver,
thanks for making that clear. Yes, CAN is a (Linux) netdevice now.
That's what we wanted. A drawback is that there are some possible
features that cannot be cleanly implemented in a netdevice.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;From the netdev perspective a CAN netdevice has to offer the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;following
</I>&gt;<i> features:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1. Sending standard and extendend frames
</I>&gt;<i> 1a. Sending standard and extendend RTR frames
</I>&gt;<i> 1b. Support of listen-only and one-shot modes
</I>&gt;<i> 1c. Send frames at maximum possible throughput on the bus
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 2. Receive standard and extendend frames
</I>&gt;<i> 2a. Receive standard and extendend RTR frames
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> And as we do not need to support hardware CAN-Identifier filtering
</I>&gt;<i> (due to the fancy SocketCAN core filterlists) we're just done here.
</I>
I guess we could even add hardware filtering support for some drivers
if we wanted to. But it's probably not worth the trouble.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I remember the implementation of the i82527 netdev driver was a real
</I>&gt;<i> pain in the back, as i needed to specify 4(!) message objects to
</I>&gt;<i> receive SFF / EFF / SFF+RTR / EFF+RTR CAN frames. And regarding the
</I>&gt;<i> priority handling of the three (possible) MSCAN TX mailboxes (see
</I>&gt;<i> above) makes it not even better.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So when we're interested in a proper loopback functionality we need to
</I>&gt;<i> skip all the curious features that had been integrated into
</I>&gt;<i> 'semi-intelligent' CAN controllers, as they are no longer needed for
</I>&gt;<i> CAN netdevices that already have their TX-FIFO inside the Linux netdev
</I>&gt;<i> queue. To realize the feature &quot;1c&quot; we would need only two TX objects
</I>&gt;<i> (aka the shadow registers in the SJA1000) and an implementation that
</I>&gt;<i> fills these two alternating TX objects as long as the netdev queue has
</I>&gt;<i> something to send.
</I>
Surely that's enough. More TX mailboxes may help in special situations,
e.g. when an application sends a block of 5 messages every 20ms. It's
nice if you get the whole queue into your hardware in one call.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> And if someone still needs DMA and 15 TX objects (but for what
</I>&gt;<i> reason??) he has to do it *without* proper loopback handling on
</I>&gt;<i> driver level.
</I>
That depends. The prerequisite is that hardware notifies the driver
with an interrupt for _every_ single message that is physically sent,
and that you can guarantee the order in which the messages are
processed. If you've got that, you can do a proper loopback, otherwise
not. The number of hardware buffers has got nothing to do with it.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Am i right here or did i miss something vital in my summary?
</I>
I think you're right, thanks again for pointing this out.

Hans
