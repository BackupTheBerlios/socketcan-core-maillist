</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Mmm, I wonder if it makes sense to offer such an additional channel for

</I>&gt;<i> enhanced raw frames (comparable to rtcan_rb_frame) down for

</I>&gt;<i> semantic for other protocols is different)?
</I>
RT-Socket-CAN does not have a TX queue for the sake of latency (raw
socket). Queuing TX message rises latency problems which might be 
overcome with TX queue priorities.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I had even plan to separate minor from message objects and allow
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> open in RD and WR only modes and do not allocate Rx queues until
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> user selects filters. I am not sure, if I would invest time
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> into it now when the socket based solution is probably preferred.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> But I would like to evaluate these possibilities in our code
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> on the other hand.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Yeah, this kind of optimisation is imaginable for RT-Socket-CAN as well.
</I>&gt;<i> Our FIFO buffer could be allocated only on bind. And if the user passed
</I>&gt;<i> some impossible filter (to exploit only device binding for
</I>&gt;<i> transmission), the FIFO could be left uncreated.
</I>
In RT-Socket-CAN RX queues are static at the moment and must be defined 
at compile time. Nevertheless, using sendto() without bind will avoid RX 
filter entries. Note that the RT-Socket-CAN implementation is &quot;lighter&quot; 
than the Socket-CAN implementation (CAN as network device).

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> on socketcan-core). Having such an interface may further improve the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> performance of data streaming applications like the one I mentioned. Of
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> course, any streaming high-level CAN protocols would be trivial to
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> address via the socket model (I guess there are some in automotive,
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> arent' they, Oliver?)
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Beyond this, I wonder how we could join forces. What critical points do
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> you see to come to a common ground, first wrt/ the user API, then later
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> maybe also to a driver model? What benefits do you see in your API
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> compared to CAN sockets (I'm not talking about the internal realisation,
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> you see that our group follows different approaches here as well)?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I do not see advantages in actual LinCAN API. But where I think,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that our code has potential, is message handling infrastructure.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Our code has been prepared internally to build queues of different
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> priorities on the fly.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> This would allow to connect additional message IDs to already open
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> handle for Rx,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Already feasible with Socket-CAN as well.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> favor priority messages for Rx and Tx.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> My believe is that ordering of incoming messages according to their
</I>&gt;<i> priority is better left to the user (attach a high prio thread to a CAN
</I>&gt;<i> socket which listens on high prio messages). We allowed such reordering
</I>&gt;<i> for a special IPC mechanism due to existing application design, and it
</I>&gt;<i> already caused some headache while trying to sort out prio inversions.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Transmission prios are a different story, see below.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Direct written messages to different queues of the chip according to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> message IDs and their priority.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This is fairly chip-specific and therefore of limited use for portable
</I>&gt;<i> CAN applications. But maybe we can address it when we do so for RX
</I>&gt;<i> queues (see below).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Recompute masks according to Rx filters (implemented).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The point is that many CAN controllers out there are fairly dumb and
</I>&gt;<i> only provide a single hardware mask. Generating that mask automatically
</I>&gt;<i> for a typical ID distribution (scattered groups of IDs) doesn't buy you
</I>&gt;<i> much. In the end, on RT systems, the system designer is responsible for
</I>&gt;<i> setting up a safe global mask that doesn't drag in unacceptable load to
</I>&gt;<i> the box.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> A different thing is some special (unportable) extension for controllers
</I>&gt;<i> that have separate RX queues in hardware. Something like assigning a
</I>&gt;<i> socket with all its filters to a specific HW-queue. Definitely a to-do!
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The infrastructure allows to build more complex message delivery meshes.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> For example Hard-RT driver can have RT clients and only one queue to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> non-rt domain, there could be messages redistributed from the hub.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Another area are redundant networks etc. 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The SJA1000 chips needs to allow cancellation of lower priority
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> message Tx if higher priority Tx is required for RT use.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Again our queues are prepared for that.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Yep, thinking about it more in details, I think we may need to have a
</I>&gt;<i> look at this prio-inversion issue again. RT-Socket-CAN would
</I>&gt;<i> unfortunately require at least a short software TX queue for dealing
</I>&gt;<i> with cancellation, Linux Socket-CAN already has stand-alone buffers and
</I>&gt;<i> may make use of skb-&gt;priority (or does already?). But can we expect such
</I>&gt;<i> TX cancellation feature of any/most controllers?
</I>
I think most CAN controllers can abort a CAN message (at least the one I 
have seen). I actually prefer, that the application does the TX queueing 
(==&gt; not TX queuing).

&gt;&gt;<i> And all that through same basic queues code and chip drivers
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> callable from RT worker thread or compiled to run in regular Linux IRQs.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Checked on Linux and RT-Linux/Linux till now. The second case allows
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> both RT and non-RT clients for same chip communication object.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I think RT/non-RT interaction is a non-issue today. If you have strict
</I>&gt;<i> RT requirement in your setup, you will pick the RT stack and typically
</I>&gt;<i> make use of it for non-RT as well. And the latter is trivial with recent
</I>&gt;<i> RT-extensions under Linux: just register your thread at lowest prio with
</I>&gt;<i> the RT core (we are even discussing to to this on demand under Xenomai)
</I>&gt;<i> and let yourself be switched back and forth when accessing the RT device.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> It would be interesting to discuss, what of these features could
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> be mapped to some socket equivalents. I have feeling, that more
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of them could be problematic/hard to implement with reasonable
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> overhead. But I can be wrong.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Your criticism is highly welcome! Throwing our know-how together can
</I>&gt;<i> actually help improving all variants and maybe even consolidating them.
</I>&gt;<i> I think that the outstanding issues can be resolve in the socket model,
</I>&gt;<i> maybe sometimes with varying efficiency, but hopefully always at a high
</I>&gt;<i> convenience and abstraction level for the end-user.
</I>
Yep.

Wolfgang.
