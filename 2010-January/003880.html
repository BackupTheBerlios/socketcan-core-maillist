&gt;<i> Dear Wolfgang,

</I>&gt;<i> First at all I would like to give my congratulations for such great work you and Socketcan's staff are doing.
</I>
You are welcome.

&gt;<i> I've been following the mailing list since the beginning and finally I'm starting my first Socketcan project that will use TWO can bus ports.
</I>&gt;<i> In this project I have two controller options for my baseboard: mpc2515 and SJA1000. Both of them could work for my project, but I would like to know your opinion about what's the best of them in terms like:
</I>&gt;<i> - Driver Features, Functionality and Community support.
</I>&gt;<i> - Source code maturity.
</I>&gt;<i> - Future kernel upgrades or code maintenance.
</I>
Both drivers are available in the mainline kernel and are at the same
level concerning the three items above, more or less.

&gt;<i> - Board porting and debugging.
</I>
For both you need some adaption for an embedded board. SPI might be a
bit more tricky, but that's a minor issue.

&gt;<i> I have the feeling that the MPC2515 is easier physically to be interfaced, but the SJA1000 driver is more mature in the socketcan project and due the interface is parallel could have a better performance. Also, would be easier to debug because, less software layers (no spidev driver).
</I>
Performance might be a problem, especially if it should operate at
1MB/s. Some users reported packet losses with the MPC251x due to little
buffering in the hardware and slower device access via SPI and work queue.

Wolfgang.
