Hi Sam,

please keep in mind, that the mainlining of CAN netdevice drivers is not 
under any pressure for now, as it turned out that the PF_CAN core 
provides an accepted interface just 5 days ago. Currently only the 
Virtual CAN driver 'vcan' has been reviewed (intensively) on the netdev 
ML before it went into net-2.6.25. The 'vcan' driver offers the 
infrastructure (Kconfig in drivers/net/can) that new drivers can be 
created for in addition. These new currently discussed drivers are 
definitely not fit for mainlining right now and therefore your comments 
on the SocketCAN ML are very welcome!

So what i've seen this evening, is that the sysfs is also the right 
interface for CAN netdevices to be supported and NOT the procfs. Of 
course we'll change that *before* posting any drivers on the 'real' 
netdev ML.

Btw. the use of the procfs is the correct interface for the PF_CAN 
networking core which has nothing to do with the CAN drivers. The stuff 
under /proc/net/can is only network layer stuff like proc/net/packet or 
/proc/net/tcp. Therefore i always insist not to mix these things up and 
to put the driver depended stuff into dev.c and not into the network 
layer code.

I assume the use of sysfs for netdevices to be quite clear. But there 
has to be a request how to add the CAN specific settings like bitrates, 
etc. into e.g. /sys/class/net/can0/* ... or are bitrates that specific 
that they even don't have a place in sysfs ??

Best regards,
Oliver
