Thanks for your feedback (both of you).

 From my experience giving some code for discussions on netdev-ML often 
helps much more than just asking for opinions without being able to give 
details.

Most of the given helper functions in net/*/*dev.c that thankfully have 
been pointed out by Wolfgang contain special handling of netdevices for 
the specific protocol family. The special handling of the PF_CAN data 
flow is already part of af_can.c (e.g. can_rcv() and can_send()).

To get a meaningful reply from the netdev people it must be clear what's 
really inside can-dev.ko to judge on the basis of the given functions 
(like bitrates, CAN states, sysfs handling, etc.). Most people look from 
the ethernet and inet point of view which might drive the discussion 
into a wrong direction.

I would suggest to ...

1. move the can-dev.ko stuff to drivers/net/can
2. make it ready for mainline
3. post it as &quot;Library framework for CAN netdevices&quot;
4. Put into the comment of the posting that we also discussed to put 
this stuff into net/can/*

Then the netdev people can discuss on a given implementation and a real 
amount of functions.

And if the discussion then goes to put it into net/can/* (what i do not 
assume) we can move it then.

In other words this is the idea from Sam &quot;tell this is the plan unless 
someone objects&quot; on the base of real code ;-)

Thanks,
Oliver
