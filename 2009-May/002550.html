I already ask for an accout at kernel.org, but no luck (==answer) yet.

</I>
Yes.

&gt;<i> I assume driver developers would post patches against the new can-2.6 tree and
</I>&gt;<i> when they are accepted, we could think about taking them into the SVN also.
</I>&gt;<i> Finally the driver maintainer (or any user of this driver) can contribute the

</I>
Right, the SVN trunk will be derived from the GIT repository sooner than
later and patches will be applied to the SVN trunk as well...

&gt;<i> And when the backward compatibility for the older kernel is selected &gt; 2.6.20
</I>&gt;<i> the ND2D() stuff becomes obsolete anyway ;-) - It's just a decision that needs
</I>&gt;<i> to be made by the driver maintainer or the driver user(s).
</I>
... and therefore I don't see a problem substituting ND2D() for
dev-&gt;dev.parent.

&gt;<i> My 'ugly' approach would allow in many cases to apply mainline fixes directly
</I>&gt;<i> to the SVN which would be a major use-case for the 'backward compatible' SVN then.
</I>
I doubt that a patch for mainline touching any dev_*() function will
apply cleanly on SVN trunk in any case. Anyhow, for the time being it's
a minor issue for me.

Wolfgang.
