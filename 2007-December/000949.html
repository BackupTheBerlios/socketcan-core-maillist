Hello Wolfgang,

as mentioned in the above text, we use default 75 for sample_pt.
This means sampling at 75% of bittime. The scan for best parameters
starts from smaller prescaler to maximum =&gt; the algorithm gives
preference to the combinations, where resolution of sample_pt
is higher, if more equivalent settings are possible.

The idea behind 75% is next:
CAN bus requires full signal propagation to all units and back
to transmitter in the time equivalent to bittime with some reserve.
These parameters limits maximal size/length of the bus/cables.
To ensure requirements with some reserve, length should limited by
propagation time equivalent to about 50% of bittime. Then selection
of middle of rest bittime interval (+25%) is reasonable selection.
If high bitrates are used and transceiver and receiver propagation
delays (mostly influenced by used optocouplers) has significant effect,
then 75% default value is not probably ideal. To compensate for
these effect there should be Tx/Rx delay specified by each board
adaptation files and it should be used to add this value converted
to time quantum and modify tseg1 and tseg2 according to this value.
But as I stated, we have not problems with 75% default. To test
optimum, it would be necessary to setup test environment with
cables and capacities equivalent to maximums allowed by physical
layer specification and measure signals and check controllers timings.
I do not time for this myself, but may it be, that we could find
some student to do that in bachelor work or in the CEPOT project
aimed to cooperation with industry.

As for SJW, there are typically very restricted ranges supported by
controllers (1-4 for SJA1000 for example) and in cases, where units
have quartz oscillators, the clock divergences are small and values
1 or 2 are enough. But anyway, if new API is specified, it would
be probably better to specify this value in percents of bittime
as well. This way it would be even more independent on concrete
controller than actual LinCAN solution. There can be even added some
weight for results selection, which would prefer timing with better
fit to required SJW and sample point values.

It would be interresting to compare these settings with combinations
suggested by different board and controllers vendors.

Best wishes

                Pavel
