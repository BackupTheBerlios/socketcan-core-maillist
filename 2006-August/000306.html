<PRE>Hi Pavel and all the others,

nice idea to continue this discussion on the socket-can mailing list ...

First i would like to reinforce the main goal of 'socket-can':

The idea is to integrate the CAN as a protocol family - next to protocol 
families like the Internet Protocol, Decnet, Appletalk, or whatever - 
into 'standard' operating systems like Linux, Windows, QNX, etc.

So it is not the plan to make any 
high_performance_for_one_special_realtime_application-hacks but to 
integrate the CAN-bus into the IT-world as good as the Internet Protocol 
has been integrated!

For this reason there are some major facts for socket-can:

- socket-can is using the standard-network-layer of the OS (here Linux) 
with all it's queueing and time-stamping mechanisms
- CAN-drivers are implemented as network-drivers (using ETH_P_CAN on 
Linux) sending struct can_frames into the network-layer
- there are different protocols inside the protocol family possible 
(currently CAN_RAW, CAN_BCM and different transport-protocols that 
create a point-to-point-connection on the CAN-Bus by segmentation of 
large messages - mostly for automotive usage as SEQ_PACKET-socket)
- there are performant filter mechanisms to supply the CAN-protocols 
with wanted CAN-Frames, that the CAN-protocols registered from the 
CAN-core (see e.g. the figure in the introduction of the 
PDF-documentation on www.llcf.de).

As Jan was not sure if the Linux-networklayer can be driven correctly in 
RT-environments, the Socket-API was discussed and confirmed as common 
sense between the 'normal' world and the RT-world. On this Socket-API 
flavour the RT-Socket-CAN was implemented using other techniques than 
the Linux-networklayer to meet the RT-requirements (e.g. with 
homemade-FIFOs instead of the standard-networklayer queueing).

So from my opinion the ideas and solutions have been worked out very 
clearly in the discussion and we are now at the point to discuss about 
new CAN-protocols (within the PF_CAN) and how to realize the additional 
requirements of some CAN-users with a standard-network-driver-interface 
approach.

E.g. if you like to send a sequence of can_frames we should discuss 
about creating some kind of CAN_RAWSEQ protocol that allows to send 
multiple frames at one syscall, or maybe we can just send multiple 
CAN-Frames on the CAN_RAW-socket (which would be splitted up inside the 
RAW-socket). On the other hand regarding the network-interface for 
CAN-controllers there might be a discussion on CAN-drivers that create 
more than one netdevice for one controller to meet the 
hardware-mailbox-filter-whatever-mechanism.

But canceling and/or reordering of CAN-Frames due to 'priorities' on 
controller/driver-level is nothing that has to be solved by the 
'standard' socket-can approach. You have to compare everthing that comes 
to your mind with standard behaviours you know from Ethernet and TCP/IP. 
To bring the CAN and it's addressing scheme into the 'well-known' world 
of Standard-IT was a tricky and ambitious job so far. E.g. the handling 
of RTR-frames in the Broadcast-Manager (CAN_BCM) or by hand with 
RAW-Sockets  (CAN_RAW) shows how requirements can be satisfied with 
socket-can inside or outside the kernel-context. Or if you do not read 
from the CAN_RAW-socket the received frames are discarded automatically 
as it is usual on other RAW-sockets.

So in my opinion RT-Socket-CAN and Socket-CAN (aka LLCF) address in some 
cases different problems and solve it with different techniques under 
one (mostly) common Socket-API. This makes this discussion that important.

As Wolfgang stated in this thread some RT-implementations (e.g. 
CAN-drivers) are 'lighter' to meet latency issues and implementing some 
kind of 'TX-queues-with-reordering' looks definitely like a task for 
RT-Socket-CAN.

I would suggest Pavel making some steps of testing with the 'standard' 
socket-can to get a feeling of the IT-flavour from socket-can. On the 
other hand i will look through the latest code from Wolfgang where Jan 
posted the Link to.

When i'm back to work next week, i will go through the different things 
Pavel pointed out on the socket-can code. But as Urs is currently on 
vacation i may not have an answer to any topic.

Best regards,

Oliver
