Hi Kurt,

this night i had a much better idea :-)

The problem is that the PGN is encoded inside the CAN-ID and therefore it was
seen as an address element so far. This leads to a wrong abstraction and wrong
thoughts about addressing in sockaddr_can.

Indeed the PGN is no address information but a data description identifier.

Comparing this to the commonly used ISO15765-2 the PGN has to be treated
analogue to the UDS SI (service identifier) of the data content that's
following in the same (UDS) ISOTP PDU.

Therefore the __u16 PGN should be the first data in the PDU that's written
into the socket - as we do with the SI in ISO15765-2. We also have the CAN-ID
in the CAN_RAW socket in the skb-&gt;data and the first element in the PDU we get
from the socket. The fact that the PGN is encoded inside the CAN-ID is a J1939
specific fact that is independent(!) from dynamic/static addressing in J1939.

This leads to the following suggestions:

- the PGN is always the first __u16 in the PDU that's read/written from/to the
socket.

- We introduce two types of CAN protocols (supported by _one_ can-j1939.ko)
    - CAN_J1939 for static addressing
    - CAN_J1939DA for dynamic addressing

- CAN_J1939 and CAN_J1939DA have different address structures (of course)

- when sending PDUs the PGN is given inside the PDU
- when receiving PDUs the PGN is given inside the PDU

- on the receiver side the PGNs can be filtered analogue to the CAN-ID filters
configured by sockopts - if needed.

This approach clearly separates the different J1939 addressing from the
content that's defined by the PGNs.

The CAN header definitions could change like this then:

 	} can_addr;

Alternatively 'j1939da' could be named 'j1939name' or something like that.

What do you think about that approach?

For me it's the first definition that makes clear what needs to be done by the
application to send PGNs to specific ECUs at first sight.

Oliver


&gt;<i> We coud so reduce the application choice between static &amp;
</I>&gt;<i> dynamic addressing to just choosing between j1939.name &amp; j1939.addr, rather
</I>&gt;<i> than choosing between API calls.
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, this choice can be made wrong. When j1939.name is set, but not
