&gt;<i> +2. Motivation
</I>&gt;<i> +--------------------------------
</I>&gt;<i> +
</I>&gt;<i> +  Given the fact there's something like SocketCAN with an API similar to BSD
</I>&gt;<i> +  sockets, we found some reasons to justify a kernel implementation for the
</I>&gt;<i> +  addressing and transport methods used by J1939.
</I>&gt;<i> +
</I>&gt;<i> +  * addressing:
</I>&gt;<i> +    When a process on an ECU communicates via j1939, it should not necessarily
</I>&gt;<i> +    know its source address. Although at least 1 process per ECU should know
</I>&gt;<i> +    the source address. Other processes should be able to reuse that address.
</I>&gt;<i> +    This way, address parameters for different processes cooperating for the
</I>&gt;<i> +    same ECU, are not duplicated.
</I>&gt;<i> +    This way of working is closely related to the unix concept where programs
</I>&gt;<i> +    do just 1 thing, and do it well.
</I>
Good idea. As long as it is transparent to the user what's going on ...

&gt;<i> +
</I>&gt;<i> +  * dynamic addressing:
</I>&gt;<i> +    Address Claiming in J1939 is time critical. Furthermore data transport
</I>&gt;<i> +    should be handled properly during the address negotiation. Putting these
</I>&gt;<i> +    functionality in the kernel eliminates this functionality as a requirement
</I>&gt;<i> +    for _every_ userspace process that communicates via J1939. This results in
</I>&gt;<i> +    a consistent J1939 bus with proper addressing.
</I>
dito.


&gt;<i> +  The j1939 sockets operate on CAN network devices (see SocketCAN). Any j1939
</I>&gt;<i> +  userspace library operating on CAN raw sockets will still operate properly.
</I>&gt;<i> +  Since such library does not communicate with the in-kernel implementation,
</I>&gt;<i> +  care must be taken that these 2 do not interfere. In practice, this means
</I>&gt;<i> +  they cannot share ECU addresses. A single ECU (or virtual ECU) address is
</I>&gt;<i> +  used by the library exclusively, or by the in-kernel system exclusively.
</I>
I'm really concerned, that there's no possibility to have more than one ECU
running on our multi-user system ...

If that would be possible, some kind of 'ecu' entry would need to be part of
the sockaddr_can, right?

&gt;<i> +
</I>&gt;<i> +
</I>&gt;<i> +3. J1939 concepts
</I>&gt;<i> +--------------------------------
</I>&gt;<i> +
</I>&gt;<i> +3.1 PGN
</I>&gt;<i> +
</I>&gt;<i> +  The PGN (Parameter Group Number) is a number to identify a packet. The PGN
</I>&gt;<i> +  is composed as follows:
</I>&gt;<i> +   1 bit  : Reserved Bit
</I>&gt;<i> +   1 bit  : Data Page
</I>&gt;<i> +   8 bits : PF (PDU Format)
</I>&gt;<i> +   8 bits : PS (PDU Specific)
</I>&gt;<i> +
</I>&gt;<i> +  In J1939-21, distinction is made between PDU1 Format (where PF &lt; 240) and
</I>&gt;<i> +  PDU2 Format (where PF &gt;= 240). Furthermore, when using PDU2 Format, the
</I>&gt;<i> +  PS-field contains a so-called Group Extension, which is part of the PGN.
</I>&gt;<i> +  When using PDU2 Format, the Group Extension is set in the PS-field.
</I>&gt;<i> +
</I>&gt;<i> +  On the other hand, when using PDU1 Format, the PS-field contains a so-called
</I>&gt;<i> +  Destination Address, which is _not_ part of the PGN. When communicating a
</I>&gt;<i> +  PGN from userspace to kernel (or visa versa) and PDU2 Format is used, the
</I>&gt;<i> +  PS-field of the PGN shall be set to zero. The Destination Address shall be
</I>&gt;<i> +  set elsewhere.
</I>
Magically :-)

&gt;<i> +
</I>&gt;<i> +  Regarding PGN mapping to 29-bit CAN identifier, the Destination Address
</I>&gt;<i> +  shall be get/set from/to the apropriate bits of the identifier by the kernel.
</I>&gt;<i> +
</I>&gt;<i> +
</I>&gt;<i> +3.2 addressing
</I>&gt;<i> +
</I>&gt;<i> +  Both static and dynamic addressing methods can be used.
</I>&gt;<i> +
</I>&gt;<i> +  For static addresses, no extra checks are made by the kernel, and provided
</I>&gt;<i> +  addresses are considered right. This responsibility is for the OEM or system
</I>&gt;<i> +  integrator.
</I>
As it is in many industrial setups.

&gt;<i> +
</I>&gt;<i> +  For dynamic addressing, so-called Address Claiming, extra support is forseen
</I>&gt;<i> +  in the kernel. In J1939 any ECU is known by it's 64-bit NAME. At the moment
</I>&gt;<i> +  of succesfull address claim, the kernel keeps track of both NAME and source
</I>&gt;<i> +  address being claimed. This serves as a base for filter schemes. By default,
</I>&gt;<i> +  packets with a destination that is not locally, will be rejected soon after
</I>&gt;<i> +  reception.
</I>&gt;<i> +
</I>&gt;<i> +  Mixed mode packets (from a static to a dynamic address or vice versa) are
</I>&gt;<i> +  allowed. The BSD sockets define seperate API calls for getting/setting the
</I>&gt;<i> +  local &amp; remote address and are applicable for J1939 sockets.
</I>
Do you mean bind() and connect() here?

I think that is not the intention of bind() and connect(), as you don't
necessarily need to perform a bind() before connect() as you do to define the
source address and the destination address.

IMO the sockaddr_can must be capable to define all these settings by only
invoking connect(). So the src &amp; dest addresses are able to be specified with
one syscall. It took some time to me to get behind this fact and it was not
very intuitive.


&gt;<i> +4. How to use J1939
</I>&gt;<i> +--------------------------------
</I>&gt;<i> +
</I>&gt;<i> +4.1 API calls
</I>&gt;<i> +
</I>&gt;<i> +  Like TCP/IP and CAN, you first need to open a socket for communicating over a
</I>&gt;<i> +  CAN network. To use j1939, include &lt;include/linux/j1939.h&gt;. From there,
</I>&gt;<i> +  &lt;include/linux/can.h&gt; will be included too.
</I>&gt;<i> +  To open a socket, you would write
</I>&gt;<i> +
</I>&gt;<i> +    s = socket(PF_CAN, SOCK_DGRAM, CAN_J1939);
</I>&gt;<i> +
</I>&gt;<i> +  J1939 does use SOCK_DGRAM sockets. In the j1939 specification, connections are
</I>&gt;<i> +  mentioned in the context of transport protocol sessions. These still deliver
</I>&gt;<i> +  packets to the other end (using several CAN packets).
</I>&gt;<i> +  SOCK_STREAM is never appropriate.
</I>
Yep. Only SOCK_SEQPACKET could be candidate ... but DGRAM simply fits here.

&gt;<i> +
</I>&gt;<i> +  After the successful creation of the socket, you would normally use the
</I>&gt;<i> +  bind(2) or connect(2) system call to bind the socket to a CAN interface
</I>&gt;<i> +  (which is different from TCP/IP due to different addressing) After binding or
</I>&gt;<i> +  connecting the socket, you can read(2) and write(2) from/to the socket or use
</I>&gt;<i> +  send(2), sendto(2), sendmsg(2) and the recv* counterpart operations on the
</I>&gt;<i> +  socket as usual. There are also J1939 specific socket options described below.
</I>&gt;<i> +
</I>&gt;<i> +  Per default j1939 is not active. Specifying can_ifindex != 0 in bind(2)
</I>&gt;<i> +  or connect(2) needs an active j1939 on that interface. You must have done
</I>&gt;<i> +  $ ip link set canX j1939 on
</I>&gt;<i> +  on that interface.
</I>
Ugh! What's that for?

&gt;<i> +
</I>&gt;<i> +  In order to send data, a bind(2) must have succeeded. bind(2) assigns a local
</I>&gt;<i> +  address to a socket. For this to succeed, you can only choose addresses
</I>&gt;<i> +  that have been assigned with '$ ip addr add j1939 .... dev canX'.
</I>
When implementing only one ECU on the host.

Now that i have read several documentation and also some j1939 API references like

 <A HREF="http://www.esd-electronics-usa.com/Shared/Handbooks/CAN-J1939StackManual.pdf">http://www.esd-electronics-usa.com/Shared/Handbooks/CAN-J1939StackManual.pdf</A>

i'm really sure that i definitely want to have more than one ECU at a time on
my host (e.g. for rest-bus-simulation) and that binding j1939 addresses to
network interfaces is broken.

&gt;<i> +  When an
</I>&gt;<i> +  empty address is assigned (ie. SA=0xff &amp;&amp; name=0), a default is taken for
</I>&gt;<i> +  the device that is bound to.
</I>
As you stated somewhere above at &quot;2. Motivation *addressing&quot; only one process
should need to keep track of setting the relevant addresses for a specific
ECU. Once the ECU is part of struct sockaddr_can this can be managed. All
processes can use the ECU-specific address information at least one of the ECU
member processes has defined.

Please keep off attaching j1939 addresses to network devices.

&gt;<i> +
</I>&gt;<i> +  Different from CAN is that the payload data is just the data that get send,
</I>&gt;<i> +  without it's header info. The header info is derived from the sockaddr
</I>&gt;<i> +  supplied to bind(2), connect(2), sendto(2) and recvfrom(2). A write(2) with
</I>&gt;<i> +  size 4 will result in a packet with 4 bytes.
</I>&gt;<i> +
</I>&gt;<i> +  The sockaddr structure has extensions for use with j1939 as specified below:
</I>&gt;<i> +      struct sockaddr_can {
</I>&gt;<i> +         sa_family_t can_family;
</I>&gt;<i> +         int         can_ifindex;
</I>&gt;<i> +         union {
</I>&gt;<i> +            struct {
</I>&gt;<i> +               __u64 name;
</I>&gt;<i> +               __u32 pgn;
</I>&gt;<i> +               __u8  addr;
</I>&gt;<i> +            } j1939;
</I>&gt;<i> +         } can_addr;
</I>&gt;<i> +      }
</I>&gt;<i> +
</I>&gt;<i> +  can_family &amp; can_ifindex serve the same purpose as for other SocketCAN sockets.
</I>
In general i wonder if it would make sense to define

struct {
    __u32 pgn;
    __u8 prio;
    __u8 src;
    __u8 dest:
    __u8 ecu;
} j1939;

As it makes *really* clear in any case - also when using sento() and
recvfrom() - what the j1939 stack does.

Even when it's a nice idea to handle all the address claiming infrastructure
inside the kernel:

1. It's not mandatory

2. Things that could be handled outside the kernel should be handled outside
the kernel. There are several userspace j1939 implementations doing so.

3. The concepts with ECUs, segments and data structures are really complex and
hard to understand and to review.

If you insist on address claiming in kernelspace you might override the given
src and dst adresses with a sockopt

SO_J1939_DEST_NAME
SO_J1939_SRC_NAME

so that these name resolved values are used on this specific bound/connected
socket instead of the given __u8 values - as an _option_.


&gt;<i> +  can_addr.j1939.pgn specifies the PGN (max 0x3ffff). Individual bits are
</I>&gt;<i> +  specified above.
</I>&gt;<i> +
</I>&gt;<i> +  can_addr.j1939.name contains the 64-bit J1939 NAME.
</I>&gt;<i> +
</I>&gt;<i> +  can_addr.j1939.addr contains the source address.
</I>&gt;<i> +
</I>&gt;<i> +  When sending data, the source address is applied as follows: If
</I>&gt;<i> +  can_addr.j1939.name != 0 the NAME is looked up by the kernel and the
</I>&gt;<i> +  corresponding Source Address is used. If can_addr.j1939.name == 0,
</I>&gt;<i> +  can_addr.j1939.addr is used.
</I>
You provide two addressing schemata in one structure here.

&gt;<i> +  After a bind(2), the local address is assigned, i.e. the source address.
</I>&gt;<i> +  After a connect(2), the remote address is assigned, i.e. the destination
</I>&gt;<i> +  address.
</I>
This is a bad approach. connect() should be able to do the job in one step.

&gt;<i> +  Both write(2) and send(2) will send a packet with local address from bind,
</I>&gt;<i> +  remote address from connect(2). When the address was not set, a broadcast is
</I>&gt;<i> +  sent. The PGN is used from bind(2) or overruled with sendto(2), which will
</I>&gt;<i> +  override the destination address when valid, and the PGN when valid.
</I>
Aehmmmm, yes?

Can you see what i think is not easy to understand?


&gt;<i> +4.3 Address Claiming
</I>&gt;<i> +
</I>&gt;<i> +  Distinction has to be made in and using the claimed address and doing an
</I>&gt;<i> +  address claim. To use an already claimed address, one has to fill in the
</I>&gt;<i> +  j1939.name member and provide it to bind(2). If the name had claimed an
</I>&gt;<i> +  address earlier, all further PGN's being sent will use that address. And the
</I>&gt;<i> +  j1939.addr member will be ignored.
</I>&gt;<i> +
</I>&gt;<i> +  An exception on this is pgn 0x0ee00. This is the &quot;Address Claim/Cannot Claim
</I>&gt;<i> +  Address&quot; message and when the kernel will use the j1939.addr member for that
</I>&gt;<i> +  pgn if necessary.
</I>
Can there be an inconsistency when the userspace process sends PGNs like this?

&gt;<i> +  To claim an address, bind(2) with:
</I>&gt;<i> +  j1939.pgn  set to 0x0ee00
</I>&gt;<i> +  j1939.addr set to the desired Source Address.
</I>&gt;<i> +  j1939.name set to the NAME you want the Source Address to claim to.
</I>&gt;<i> +
</I>&gt;<i> +  Afterwards do a write(2) with data set to the NAME (Little Endian). If the
</I>&gt;<i> +  NAME provided, does not match the j1939.name provided to bind(2), EPROTO
</I>&gt;<i> +  will be returned. One might use sendto(2) also to send the Addres Claim. In
</I>&gt;<i> +  that case, the j1939.addr member must be set to the broadcast address (255)
</I>&gt;<i> +  and the j1939.pgn must be set to 0x0ee00. If This combination is not given,
</I>&gt;<i> +  EPROTO is returned.
</I>
Why EPROTO?


&gt;<i> +  If no-one else contest the address claim within 250ms after transmission, the
</I>&gt;<i> +  kernel marks the NAME-SA assignment as valid. The valid assignment will be
</I>&gt;<i> +  kept, among other valid NAME-SA assignments. From that point, any socket
</I>&gt;<i> +  bound to the NAME can send packets.
</I>&gt;<i> +
</I>&gt;<i> +  If another ECU claims the address, the kernel will mark the NAME-SA expired.
</I>&gt;<i> +  No socket bound to the NAME can send packets (other than address claims).
</I>&gt;<i> +  To claim another address, some socket bound to NAME, must bind(2) again,
</I>&gt;<i> +  but with only j1939.addr changed to the new SA, and must then send a
</I>&gt;<i> +  valid address claim packet. This restarts the state machine in the kernel
</I>&gt;<i> +  (and any other participant on the bus) for this NAME.
</I>
This is the complexity i would prefer to leave out of the kernel ...

&gt;<i> +5 Socket Options
</I>&gt;<i> +--------------------------------
</I>&gt;<i> +
</I>&gt;<i> +  j1939 sockets have some options that are configurable via setsockopt(2).
</I>&gt;<i> +  Each of those options is initialized with a reasonable default.
</I>&gt;<i> +
</I>
&gt;<i> +5.2 SO_J1939_PROMISC
</I>&gt;<i> +
</I>&gt;<i> +  When set, j1939 will receive all packets, not just those with a destination
</I>&gt;<i> +  on the local system.
</I>&gt;<i> +  default off.
</I>&gt;<i> +
</I>&gt;<i> +    int promisc = 1; /* 0 = disabled (default), 1 = enabled */
</I>&gt;<i> +
</I>&gt;<i> +    setsockopt(s, SOL_CAN_J1939, SO_J1939_PROMISC, &amp;promisc, sizeof(promisc));
</I>
I think this also belongs to the fact, that you are attaching j1939 addresses
to network interfaces, right?

&gt;<i> +5.4 SO_J1939_RECV_DEST
</I>&gt;<i> +
</I>&gt;<i> +  Received j1939 packets that make their way up to the socket, had a destination
</I>&gt;<i> +  address matching the socket's local address. This can have several reasons:
</I>&gt;<i> +  - broadcast packet.
</I>&gt;<i> +  - destination spec matches the local address
</I>&gt;<i> +  - destination spec matches _a_ local address on the system, and the socket
</I>&gt;<i> +    had no local address defined.
</I>&gt;<i> +  - SO_J1939_PROMISC was set
</I>&gt;<i> +  If the user is interested in the original destination spec, SO_J1939_RECV_DEST
</I>&gt;<i> +  can be changed to 1 to receive the destination spec with each packet.
</I>&gt;<i> +  The destination is attached to the msghdr in the recvmsg(2) call.
</I>
Why this option? Is using recvmsg() not enough to detect this info to be
retrieved?

&gt;<i> +5.5 SO_J1939_RECV_PRIO
</I>&gt;<i> +
</I>&gt;<i> +  As stated earlier, the priority field is stripped very soon. In order to
</I>&gt;<i> +  allow retreiving the packet's priority, SO_J1939_RECV_PRIO can be set to 1.
</I>&gt;<i> +
</I>&gt;<i> +  As a result, an extra int will be attached during recvmsg(2), similar
</I>&gt;<i> +  as in SO_J1939_RECV_DEST, but with cmsg_type == SCM_J1939_PRIO
</I>&gt;<i> +
</I>&gt;<i> +6.6 SO_J1939_SEND_PRIO
</I>&gt;<i> +
</I>&gt;<i> +  To set the priority field for outgoing packets, the SO_J1939_SEND_PRIO can
</I>&gt;<i> +  be changed. This int field specifies the priority that will be used.
</I>&gt;<i> +  j1939 defines a priority between 0 and 7 inclusive,
</I>&gt;<i> +  with 7 the lowest priority.
</I>&gt;<i> +  Per default, the priority is set to 6 (conforming J1939).
</I>&gt;<i> +  This priority socket option operates on the same value that is modified
</I>&gt;<i> +  with
</I>&gt;<i> +
</I>&gt;<i> +    setsockopt(s, SOL_SOCKET, SO_PRIORITY, &amp;pri, sizeof(pri))
</I>&gt;<i> +
</I>&gt;<i> +  socketoption, with a difference that SOL_SOCKET/SO_PRIORITY is defined with
</I>&gt;<i> +  0 the lowest priority. SOL_CAN_J1939/SO_J1939_SEND_PRIO inverts this value
</I>&gt;<i> +  for you.
</I>
Why is the priority not part of sockaddr_can in the same way as the PGN?

&gt;<i> +
</I>&gt;<i> +5.7 SO_J1939_DEST_MASK
</I>&gt;<i> +
</I>&gt;<i> +  When a destination is specified by its name (and thus using dynamic addressing),
</I>&gt;<i> +  and such name should be unique amongst the world, it may be hard to predict the
</I>&gt;<i> +  name of eg. a gearbox controller on the bus, although its type and manufacturer
</I>&gt;<i> +  are know. This is because the serial number is part of the name.
</I>&gt;<i> +  To simplify specifying a destination, a per-socket destination mask is provided
</I>&gt;<i> +  that is activated whenever a destination name is wanted. Any bits cleared in
</I>&gt;<i> +  this mask are ignored during the lookup. As a result, more than 1 ECU may match
</I>&gt;<i> +  this name/mask pair. In all cases, the first match is used.
</I>&gt;<i> +  The API is thus capable of specifying a name for eg. the gearbox controller,
</I>&gt;<i> +  without knowing its serial number.
</I>
Yes. The address claiming and name handling inside the kernel is a heavy thing.

&gt;<i> +  This mask can mask out any part in the name. Note there's only 1 mask per socket.
</I>&gt;<i> +
</I>&gt;<i> +  this mask is default set to mask the serial number.
</I>&gt;<i> +
</I>&gt;<i> +  when can_addr.j1939.name is used for destination in outgoing packets
</I>&gt;<i> +  (see bind(2), sendto(2)), the exact name is often not known due to serial
</I>&gt;<i> +  numbers in it.
</I>&gt;<i> +  Therefore, SO_J1939_DEST_MASK sets an uint64_t mask that will be used
</I>&gt;<i> +  for resolving these names. Only the bits set to 1 in the mask will be
</I>&gt;<i> +  evaluated for find the destination name.
</I>&gt;<i> +  Per default, the mask is set to mask out the serial number
</I>&gt;<i> +  (0xffffffffffe00000ULL)
</I>&gt;<i> +
</I>&gt;<i> +  to mask out only the manufacturer code (bits 21-31), do
</I>&gt;<i> +
</I>&gt;<i> +    uint64_t mask = 0xffffffff001fffffULL;
</I>&gt;<i> +
</I>&gt;<i> +    setsockopt(s, SOL_CAN_J1939, SO_J1939_DEST_MASK, &amp;mask, sizeof(mask));
</I>&gt;<i> +
</I>&gt;<i> +
</I>&gt;<i> +6. /proc Interface.
</I>&gt;<i> +--------------------------------
</I>&gt;<i> +
</I>&gt;<i> +
</I>&gt;<i> +  Files giving you a view on the in-kernel operation of J1939 are located at:
</I>&gt;<i> +  /proc/net/j1939.
</I>&gt;<i> +
</I>&gt;<i> +6.1 /proc/net/j1939/ecu
</I>&gt;<i> +
</I>&gt;<i> +  This file gives an overview of the known ECU's to the kernel.
</I>&gt;<i> +  - iface : network interface they operate on.
</I>&gt;<i> +  - SA : current address.
</I>&gt;<i> +  - name : 64bit NAME
</I>&gt;<i> +  - flags : 'L' = local, 'R' = remote
</I>&gt;<i> +
</I>
Ah, you have ECUs - can you have more that one ECU marked as 'L'ocal?


&gt;<i> +6.3 /proc/net/j1939/sock
</I>&gt;<i> +
</I>&gt;<i> +  This file gives a list of all j1939 sockets currently open.

Indeed this shows, that my suggestion for the struct j1939 in sockaddr_can is
not that far from the contents you need.

&gt;<i> +6.4 /proc/net/j1939/stack
</I>&gt;<i> +
</I>&gt;<i> +  The internal j1939 is build with a stack of code blocks. This blocks are
</I>&gt;<i> +  passed for each packet (both RX &amp; TX).
</I>&gt;<i> +  this file gives an insight view on this stack.
</I>&gt;<i> +  - prio : level, priority
</I>
Why has the _stack_ a priority?

&gt;<i> +  - name :
</I>&gt;<i> +  - tx matches :
</I>&gt;<i> +  - rx matches :
</I>&gt;<i> +
</I>&gt;<i> +
</I>&gt;<i> +6.5 /proc/net/j1939/transport
</I>&gt;<i> +
</I>&gt;<i> +
</I>&gt;<i> +6.6 /proc/sys/net/j1939 - SYSCTL
</I>&gt;<i> +
</I>&gt;<i> +  Via these sysctl files, several parameters of the j1939 module can be tuned.
</I>&gt;<i> +
</I>&gt;<i> +  - /proc/sys/net/j1939/loop [bool]:
</I>&gt;<i> +    Control if packets with local source _and_ local destination may be (true)
</I>&gt;<i> +    loopback'd (injected directly in the receive path from the transmit path)
</I>&gt;<i> +    or (false, default) must be sent on CAN via the regular transmit path.
</I>
Is done by sockopts - don't specify two interfaces for one functionality.

&gt;<i> +
</I>&gt;<i> +  - /proc/sys/net/j1939/promisc [bool]:
</I>&gt;<i> +    Specifies PROMISC mode for the whole stack, i.e. _all_ J1939-sockets. The
</I>&gt;<i> +    PROMISC mode is normally set per socket via setsockopt(2).
</I>
Dito. Here you already detected the problem by yourself :-)


&gt;<i> +  - /proc/sys/net/j1939/tp/max_packet_size [int]:
</I>&gt;<i> +    Is the maximum packet size to accept on both transmit &amp; receive side.
</I>&gt;<i> +    Bigger packets will be rejected (local sender), aborted (local receiver)
</I>&gt;<i> +    or ignored (broadcasts &amp; remote recievers in PROMISC).
</I>
What's that for?
Why is it a global setting and not a sockopt?

&gt;<i> +  - /proc/sys/net/j1939/tp/preferred_block_count [int]:
</I>&gt;<i> +    Controls how many data packets the TP &amp; ETP will receive before requiring
</I>&gt;<i> +    flow control packets.
</I>
Why is it a global setting and not a sockopt?
Make it a constant that can be overridden via sockopt.

&gt;<i> +
</I>&gt;<i> +  - /proc/sys/net/j1939/tp/queue_len [int]:
</I>&gt;<i> +    Controls how many pending packets the TP module may queue before returning
</I>&gt;<i> +    ENOBUFS to sender. Note this is not the only source of ENOBUFS, the CAN
</I>&gt;<i> +    device driver may also return ENOBUFS.
</I>
Make it a constant - or at least a Kconfig option

&gt;<i> +  - /proc/sys/net/j1939/tp/retry_ms [int]:
</I>&gt;<i> +    Controls how many time to wait before retrying to send an individual TP
</I>&gt;<i> +    flow or data packet after transmission failure.
</I>
Make it a constant that can be overridden via sockopt.

Summarizing you really started an interesting new CAN protocol for PF_CAN but
especially the current socket API is not easy to understand and hides to much
of the real world complexity in an unfortunate way. The lack of multiple ECU
support on a single host (coming hand-in-hand with addresses attached to
network interfaces) needs some rework. There is not reason on a multi-user
system to stay away from a multi-ECU support that's implemnted in userspace
j1939 stacks (as referenced above).

If it's clear to me as a j1939 newbie, then it's probably mature enough. So
far the socket API is confusing me.

Thanks,
Oliver
