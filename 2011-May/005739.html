&quot;Unwanted&quot; is not the right word. I see it as a piece of CAN hardware
with some serious limitations and I doubt that it will make real CAN
users happy. But well, I might be wrong.

&gt;<i> If that interpretation is right, I would seriously recommend rethinking

</I>
It would be really nice if they could provide a better firmware. Anyway,
the generic CAN hardware filter interface we spoke about in a previous
mail would fit for the PRUSS CAN hardware as well. It just needs to be
implemented.

Wolfgang.
