<PRE>Hi,

During filtering of CAN msgs, I noticed that if I apply a SFF filter
(11bit id), EFF (29 bit id) msgs that match in the lowest 11bits come
through the filter too.

I noticed this with using candump.

I do not think this behaviour is wanted. If EFF msgs were subject to SFF
filters, it should at least apply on the highest 11bits anyway.

Now that I have a spare moment, I went in the code. The following patch
is what I came up with. I have not tested this well yet, but I think it
should do the trick. But, my views on socketcan filters are quite
limited yet. Does anyone see how this would affect other functionality
badly?

The idea behind this is that the EFF flag is, just as the RTR flag, a
part of the can id. when the mask will be applied on a received can_id,
both RTR flag, EFF flag must match, in _all_ cases, also the SFF msgs.
Applying the EFF-flag in the mask of a SFF message does not really hurt,
consumes no cpu cycles at all, and guarantees that a EFF msg will not
come through a SFF filter (which has EFF cleared in the can_id, but EFF
      set in mask)

by looking in the filtering code, I think I got some other interesting
scenario. If 2 filters were applied on a single socket, an incoming msg
is delivered to each matching filter, not necessarily once per socket.
This would only pose a problem when filters with overlapping ranges are
applied on a single socket. I have no solution for this yet, nor do I
experience the problem _yet_. But I'd like to question this behaviour.
