That looks unusual.

connect() is for &quot;connected&quot; (like TCP) and bind() for &quot;connectionless&quot; protocols.

Maybe connect is completely wrong in J1939 contexts.

You should probably use the special SA/DA values to indicate broadcast addresses.

</I>
But virtual ECUs distinguish from SA, right?
Then it's not 'visible' in the concept.


&gt;&gt;<i> I think, when you defined a socket with all these information in the

</I>
ack. ack. :-)

&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> where not all fields are necessarily used in all api calls.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> note that this does go further than only implementing the transport

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> This is the major point for me and picks up my last comment above.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> When you send more than 8 bytes to a connected socket (that has both the local

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> IMO defining communication relations (via addresses) and let the kernel do the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> transport protocol is the API we should create on the J1939 sockets.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> In general, we could alternatively think about using raw-sockets for all types

</I>&gt;<i> different sockets, based on the size of the communication, is a bad
</I>&gt;<i> thing. On that level, I do not want to keep track of which socket to
</I>&gt;<i> use.
</I>
Was just an idea. But for data you are right. That's fine to me.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Note that the transport protocol in j1939 uses 2 pgns, but such thing
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> should still be described with (SA, DA, PGN, PRIORITY).
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> After reading the relevant man pages &amp; looking at the sockaddr_can
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> above, the only debate I see is wether to set SA from connect(), and DA
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> from bind(). That the only documenting up to here.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> When you say 'redundant parts', I can suggest
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> that sa &amp; da do not necessarily be in the same structure. uint8_t addr
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> would be sufficient too. in bind(), it means SA, in connect() it means
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> DA, etc, etc.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> For getting the precise DA in recvfrom, a getsockopt could be used
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> (similar to timestamps).
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> struct sockaddr_can {
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>    ...
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>    union {
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>       struct {
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>          uint8_t addr;
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>          uint8_t priority;
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>          uint32_t pgn;
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>       } j1939;
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>    } can_addr;
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> };
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> At the next level, j1939 describes a dynamic addressing scheme (the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> above is working fine with static addresses only). That's especially
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> used a lot in agriculture (our main market).
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> At that point, SA &amp; DA are not persistent anymore, but the 8byte name
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> is.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> We intent not to let kernel code participate in this dynamic
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> addressing,
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> but let the kernel code follow the actions on the bus. Since a single
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> instance must decide which name an SA belongs to &amp; vice versa, the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> kernel is the perfect place.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> No.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I checked the idea of the Dynamic Address Configuration in SAE J1939 here
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     <A HREF="http://www.can-wiki.info/SaeJ1939">http://www.can-wiki.info/SaeJ1939</A>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and this is definitely something that has to be handled outside the kernel.
</I>&gt;<i> Like I mentioned, the actions are taken in userspace, but the kernel
</I>&gt;<i> should track when a SA is valid and when not.
</I>
And when it's not - what happens?
Is the socket collapsing after sending a socket error?

So far i cannot see a value in putting the name into the kernel. When the
address becomes invalid the application needs to be informed to close and/or
re-initialize it's connections. E.g. with signals or from the (already planned
daemon).

Like this one:

&gt;&gt;<i> Better write a daemon and/or library for that like for DNS in IP.
</I>&gt;<i> ack, 1 daemon per SA or so was our plan
</I>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Lenadro says:
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> My suggestion for the J1939 stack is, a user space library with emphasis in
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> the decoupling of the application protocol (in this case the J1939 protocol)
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> from the under laying library, make it dependant only of the most
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> minimalistic API possible (easy to be ported) for configure, get status,
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> send and receive messages (in this case socketcan).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I can follow many of your thoughts but this would base on can-raw sockets
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> entirely.
</I>&gt;<i> ack
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> IMO we should use the kernel at least where it could help us to meet the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> timing requirements (e.g. the 50ms) for the J1939 specific transport of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> segmented information.
</I>&gt;<i> ack
</I>&gt;<i> help in: transport sessions &amp; address claim tracking
</I>
Commented above.

&gt;&gt;<i> A stated above i might make sense to use the CAN filters of the can-raw
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> socket(s) to handle all the single frame communication (including the address
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> configuration). An to handle the raw/j1939 sockets transparently could be the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> job for the userspace library.
</I>
&gt;<i> but different processes using the same SA with different PGN suffer
</I>&gt;<i> collisions when they use transport protocol.
</I>
Independently from a library this problem has to be solved anyway. If you
start your ECU-application twice it will clash.

&gt;&gt;<i> For the segmented data transfer the ISO15765-2 implementation in the SVN could
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> be a good starting point for an implementation.
</I>&gt;<i> see above. to avoid specially crafted programs, I'd put also &lt;8byte
</I>&gt;<i> messages via such socket.
</I>
Ack.

&gt;<i> another point is collisions between different transport sessions of the
</I>&gt;<i> same SA. the ISO15765-2 works on a single set of can_id's, that can
</I>&gt;<i> collide anyway, so no problem is introduced there.
</I>&gt;<i> With j1939 transport implemented the same way, you suggest a user that
</I>&gt;<i> it works, but a possible collision(no, bad word, corruption) is
</I>&gt;<i> introduced if it were not aware of other users.
</I>
As stated ~14 lines above ..

&gt;<i> When a user want j1939 communication, he/she should be able to just open
</I>&gt;<i> the socket, do bind()/connect() as he/she pleases, and start sending.
</I>&gt;<i> A common mistake when using j1939 (at least I found that) is to deal
</I>&gt;<i> with CAN raw messages instead of j1939 packets. This works like a brake
</I>&gt;<i> on applications. One should be able to ignore the actual CAN raw
</I>&gt;<i> messages, and work with J1939 packets instead.
</I>
The J1939 (sockets) just give you a different view on the CAN, where the world
is good and the sun is shining.

Who want's to use can-raw in J1939 environments then?

And that your 'DNS' daemon probably uses can-raw is hidden from the users ;-)

Finally (even if i do not like it) a socketoption containing the 64 bit name
can be placed into the socket as soon as it is created. Before or after bind()
is irrelevant.
