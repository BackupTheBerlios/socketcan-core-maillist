</I>
Almost nobody is working with the bleeding edge kernel and there is some
real benefit for the users providing backward compatibility. This does
not mean that we spend time for providing support for very old kernels,
at least not without real demand. Oliver introduced:

  #if LINUX_VERSION_CODE &lt; KERNEL_VERSION(2,6,22)
  #error This driver does not support Kernel versions &lt; 2.6.22
  #endif

which makes clear what kernel versions are supported.

&gt;&gt;<i> And in most cases the developer can post git-patches based on net-next-2.6
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> which becomes the leading development repository.
</I>&gt;<i> Great.
</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i> It's not a difference for you, I know. ;-) But I guess persons without write

</I>
We all known the advantages of git and that's why I said it's a valuable
option.

&gt;&gt;<i> Looks the described process sane to all of you?
</I>&gt;<i> Let summarize:
</I>&gt;<i> Work on already mainlined drivers or new drivers is done on net-next-2.6. Not yet
</I>&gt;<i> mainlined drivers becomes ready for mainlining in the out-of-tree repository which
</I>&gt;<i> we move to GIT.
</I>
In principle yes, but it's not a real requirement that the driver must
first be for the SVN trunk. Patches directly for net-next-2.6 are
accepted as well, of course, if they are OK. See the ti_hecc driver
posted recently. When it gets accepted, it's not a big deal to adapt it
for the out-of-tree SVN code.

&gt;<i> Ok for me.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> There is another option (just a thought worth). The staging-tree is indented for
</I>&gt;<i> drivers which are not yet ready for kernel inclusion. This criteria matches for all
</I>&gt;<i> currently not yet mainlined drivers. Why not moving them to the staging tree so
</I>&gt;<i> we have all drivers in net-next-2.6? This would also increase the audience of kernel
</I>&gt;<i> developers which may take look at this drivers to help us, getting them out of staging?
</I>
Honestly, it's a *waste* time and I also do not want that pre-mature and
buggy drivers enter the mainline kernel. I'm really surprised that it's
possible at all.

Wolfgang.
