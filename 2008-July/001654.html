<PRE>Wolfgang,

I suspect you're currently working on the bittiming stuff.
In between, I played with the can-dev module, and did to the following:

1/4: the patch I already sent you earlier, on the incorporation of the SJW field
I just needed this to go in front to clean it from the others.
2/4: added a samplept field, to express the samplept. I believe this is inevitable for CAN.
I modified the can_calc_bittiming function in order to do so, it seems to work for me.
3/4: an IOCTL interface, based on SIOCDEVPRIVATE calls. This is the major thing in this series.
The interface structures are quite preliminary, but it may give someone ideas.
There, I also added a program, canbr, to set or get
the bittiming.
I like some interface like that. I am not trying to get rid of the sysfs interface, but when bittiming
gets beyond only bitrate/samplepoint, I believe the sysfs get huge. For such complexity, I think
such IOCTL interface is cleaner.
4/4: while getting in the source code, I found a function pointer for changing MTU.
I did not have issues yet, but cancelling here seemed like a good idea.

I started using quilt in order to create cleaner patches. applying must be done with -p1 !

These patches are probably not production ready, as the bittiming is still evolving. It's more a try
to help simplifying the job. Just let me know if it gets usefull.

Kurt
