</I>I assume that with &quot;work on&quot; you ask if people without a kernel.org
account can push stuff to can-2.6.git.
This is not possible as you need to authenticate with ssh before
you can push stuff to the git tree at kernel.org.

I assume this is because you come from the svn &quot;multiple people
with commit rights&quot; workflow. For git is is so simple to branch
and merge that when you get used to it you will not miss
the commit rights for everyone anymore.

When you have the git tree at kernel.org everyone can fetch/pull from
there, edit and send patches to you or maybe even apply to a local
git tree you can pull from.

There is a snapshot mechanishm so non-git users can get a zipped
copy of the source but that is rather ineffective as this
would fetch the full kernel source and I do not think it
is very usefull.

The best would be to encourage people to work on latest
-rc from Linus so they really work on mainline stuff.
Or maybe on top of -next for the upcoming stuff.


For kbuild.git that I maintain I only get patches made
on top of latest from Linus and occasionally on top
of -mm and so far it has not caused me troubles handling.

And adding a patch I receive by mail is usually like this:

review patch
save mail
edit subject and changelog + add my &quot;Signed-off-by&quot;
Sometimes I edit the patch itself in various ways
test
$git am patch

In the above workflow it is the &quot;review patch&quot; and
the occasional &quot;edit patch + testing&quot; that takes time.

This I repeat a number of times and when stuff is ready to
be published I do a:
git push ...
