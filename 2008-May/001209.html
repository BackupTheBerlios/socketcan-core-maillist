</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; Sooner than later the upstream maintainers would like to deal just
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; with *one* maintainer, I'm afraid. But we are not yet that far.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt;   
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; This is no real issue. Search the MAINTAINERs file for 'NETWORK' and 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; you'll see, that there are maintainers for single network drivers as 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; well as for complete network layers. E.g.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; grep -A2 AX.25 MAINTAINERS
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; So it is not even usual to tunnel all the stuff via one single
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; person. When there is much upstream traffic it makes sense to cluster
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; things - like Jeff Garzik does for the net drivers. But this is a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; floating process and i can't see why we should expose a single person
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; for all the CAN stuff.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Yes, that's neither necessary nor desirable. One person can be ill, on
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; holidays, or occupied by other work.
</I>&gt;<i> Most of the kernel subsystems rely on a single person today.
</I>
I know. But with the increasing speed of kernel development we saw quite
a few maintainers trying to decrease their workload. Jean Delvare gave
lm-sensors to Mark Hoffman and was looking for an i2c co-maintainer.
Greg KH dropped PCI maintainership. x86 has three maintainers.

CAN seems to be a very small subsystem at a first glance. But I think
bringing CAN drivers to mainline will be a lot of work for a maintainer,
let alone the maintenance work that'll come up after people started
using these drivers.

AFAICT, there's nobody ATM who will be paid for socketcan maintainer
work. That's why I voted for splitting responsibility between two or three
people. But I agree that it's not our major problem ATM. SocketCAN could
start with one maintainer, we'll soon enough find out if it works or
not.

&gt;<i> The net subsystem rely solely on David Miller for example. There are
</I>&gt;<i> obvious lots of contributors behing David - the can people is some of them.
</I>&gt;<i> But to get -net stuff into the kernel we all rely on David to do his
</I>&gt;<i> share of the work.
</I>
Yes, but David doesn't do it in his leisure time, does he?

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; IMO, the important thing is &quot;one
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; place&quot;, not &quot;one person&quot;. There should be one and only one repository
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (be it git, svn, quilt queue or whatever) where one can get the latest
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; state of socketcan stuff.
</I>&gt;<i> Two places I would say. The latest stabilized stuff can be found
</I>&gt;<i> in the mainline kernel.
</I>
Yes, of course, I forgot that one ;-)

&gt;<i> The stuff planned for the next merge window can be found
</I>&gt;<i> in another place.
</I>
That's what I meant.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Again - this is the model used by many subsytems in the kernel
</I>&gt;<i> with success and CAN is not special here.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> And based on other comments on this list is seems
</I>&gt;<i> that driver stuff will be serate from core CAN stuff and that
</I>&gt;<i> core CAN stuff may only be found in -net (and mainline kernel)
</I>&gt;<i> which is again what other subsystems often do - so this is a
</I>&gt;<i> known model.
</I>
My main concern is transparency. If a developer starts work, he should
know against which tree he should build his patches. After the patch was
discussed and accepted on the mailing list, it should be absolutely
clear what happens next, e.g. who will apply the patch to which tree,
and when will it hit mainline. I had some bad experiences with the ARM
tree in the past where an accepted patch disappeared in who-knows-who's
tree until a crippled not-functional version of my patch showed up in
mainline three month later... (I must add that they've improved
their workflow meanwhile)

Thanks,
Hans
