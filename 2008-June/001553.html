</I>&gt;<i> Thanks for your request. I also took a look on the current Linux Softing

</I>&gt;<i> think. (do you already have a patch for that?)
</I>I tried the driver 2 years back, but it lacks proper CAN support 
(multiple processes, single bus).
I wrote my own framework around it, which I'm porting to socketCAN now.
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> But i did not start to rework the driver for netdevice support as i got 
</I>&gt;<i> somehow confused due to the dpram connection and the integrated 
</I>&gt;<i> intelligence of the card.
</I>I used their driver as reference :-)

I had the initial tought on adding it into subversion, or should I send 
patches.
How about the firmware (bin files).
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> This card is not a regular CAN chip, it has a micocontroller (with CAN 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> chip), which does 'some' processing.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I do have the option to get feedback on transmitted CAN messages, but 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I have no clue on how to glue this into socketCAN skb's.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I could use the predefined loopback option, but this ignores the fact 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that a specific message does not actually get sent, altought the card 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> can provide that information.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> But this feedback from the card is pretty fine.
</I>The thing I see is : I have high performance transmit, as a TX queue exists.
This queue has no room for extra things like skb references.
When a TX is done, I have no fixed reference on which skb was tx'd (with 
regard to source socket)
I think I must do best guess, which is probably rather fine.

Currently, I had something that drops the skb after queueing, and 
creates a new skb after acknowledge.
This, of course, looses the source socket, but does it hurt?
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The loopback process work like this:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> - CAN driver get's a skb with a struct can_frame (in the skb-data section)
</I>&gt;<i> - put the CAN frame into the controller and start the transmission
</I>&gt;<i> - save the CAN frame to loopback the frame on successful transmission
</I>&gt;<i> ( wait for end of transmission =&gt; TX ok interrupt)
</I>&gt;<i> - at tx interrupt get the saved skb and push it to the receive queue
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> That's all.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The idea is to 'echo' only CAN frames that touched the CAN bus properly 
</I>&gt;<i> (and with a correct timestamp that varies due to the arbitration process).
</I>&gt;<i> So when you get an error from your card and the CAN frame could not be 
</I>&gt;<i> sent, you can discard (==free) the (saved) skbuff containing the 
</I>&gt;<i> outgoing CAN frame.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Did the idea behind the interface flag IFF_ECHO become more clearly to you?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If you could not provide the information about the correctly sent frames 
</I>&gt;<i> and therefore could not provide a proper loopback handling on driver 
</I>&gt;<i> level, you must not set the IFF_ECHO flag (this makes the CAN 
</I>&gt;<i> networklayer do the loopback but without timestamp accuracy).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>Thanks
Kurt
