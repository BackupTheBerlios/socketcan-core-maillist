AFAICS there are three types of CAN controllers out there:

- Controllers that support single-shot support frame-by-frame *1
- Controllers that can switch single-shot at configuration time *2
- Controllers that do not support single shot at all *3

*1: SJA1000, BF5xx, MPC2515, ...
*2: AT89C51CC02, ...
*3: i82527, ...

Additionally i do not know any CAN-adaptor that is not accessible 
directly (e.g. USB-adaptors) that support single-shot transmisions.

&gt;<i>  During this period it would be necessary to
</I>&gt;<i> ensure no other users of the device sent any frames, because they would
</I>&gt;<i> be sent single-shot, potentially against the wishes of the user.  This
</I>&gt;<i> would need some device mutual exclusion at a higher level.
</I>
Yep! This taps exactly into the problem, i can see here also.
For that reason i tend to let the sysadmin switch the single-shot mode 
for the appropriate controller (which may also give a negative result 
when the interface/controller does not support single-shot) than to 
provide an user-interface for these different communication modes.

 From what i've learned until now the CAN bus is used in single-shot 
(e.g. for TTCAN or NMEA2000 address claim phase) OR normal operation 
mode at one time. So an administrative interface for single-shot claims 
to be the right solution here.

Why overloading an user-interface for things that could and should be 
solved better on an administrative level?

Oliver
