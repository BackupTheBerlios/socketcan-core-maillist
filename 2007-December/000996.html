Yep.

&gt;<i> I remember the implementation of the i82527 netdev driver was a real

</I>&gt;<i> not even better.
</I>
I already doubt in a previous mail that using 15 TX hardware buffers has
some real benefit.

&gt;<i> So when we're interested in a proper loopback functionality we need to
</I>&gt;<i> skip all the curious features that had been integrated into
</I>&gt;<i> 'semi-intelligent' CAN controllers, as they are no longer needed for CAN
</I>&gt;<i> netdevices that already have their TX-FIFO inside the Linux netdev

</I>&gt;<i> (aka the shadow registers in the SJA1000) and an implementation that
</I>&gt;<i> fills these two alternating TX objects as long as the netdev queue has
</I>&gt;<i> something to send.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> And if someone still needs DMA and 15 TX objects (but for what reason??)
</I>&gt;<i> he has to do it *without* proper loopback handling on driver level.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Am i right here or did i miss something vital in my summary?
</I>
Maybe, here some doc from the MSCAN manual:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Modern application layer software is built upon two fundamental assumptions:

&#8226; Any CAN node is able to send out a stream of scheduled messages
without releasing the bus between the two messages.
Such nodes arbitrate for the bus immediately after sending the previous
message and only release the bus in case of lost
arbitration.

&#8226; The internal message queue within any CAN node is organized such that
the highest priority message is sent out first, if
more than one message is ready to be sent.

The above behavior cannot be achieved with a single transmit buffer.
That buffer must be reloaded right after the previous message is sent.
This loading process lasts a finite amount of time and has to be
completed within the Inter-Frame Sequence (IFS)1 to be able to send an
uninterrupted stream of messages. Even if this is feasible for limited
CAN bus speeds, it requires that the CPU react with short latencies to
the transmit interrupt.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

I have done some measurements with the MSCAN in the past but have not
realized any performance improvements from using all 3 TX buffers,
nevertheless, I'm not a hardware expert.

I would restrict the FIFO depth to 3 or 4 messages.

Another point is (soft) real-time behavior. If you have many messages
queued in hardware, QoS (implemented in software) cannot work properly.

Wolfgang.
