<PRE>Hello,

Thanks for quick reply.

Obviously, I am not replacing spi_sync with spi_async only :)

&gt;<i> That said it's a nice thing to rewrite the driver without the need of

</I>&gt;<i> just a matter of &quot;M-X replace-string spi_sync spi_async&quot;, otherwise we
</I>&gt;<i> cannot help.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I am trying to re-write (modify) driver's tx and rx processing paths
_but_ initially doing most of the work (calling spi_async and others)
from work-queue to avoid extra complications added from
interrupt-contexts and completion function is doing only what is
necessary (in xmit case its doing nothing although I tried to issue
async write for TXREQ from here but that also resulted in crash).

I will post code here asap as at the moment my modifications are still
not finished on rx path and code needs cleanup before posting.

&gt;<i> BTW: what motivates your work?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I already have async driver which is modified version of around 1-year
old socket-can driver and works very well in our required work-load
without dropping any packets as compare to synchronous driver. But the
problem is: that driver don't do proper error handling especially in
case of floating CAN-bus it just lock-down whole system due to its
continuous interrupt processing (and crashes kernel if bus is attached
to CAN device when system is locked).

So now rather fixing that issue in old driver, I took latest svn-tree
and trying to make it asynchronous. My current approach is to leave
all the rx error processing as it is in work-handler but do
normal-packets processing without deferring them. Any comment on this
?
