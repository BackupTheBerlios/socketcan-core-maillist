</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Nobody else who submits networking patches has this problem, they are

</I>
I must admit, that, reading the discussion on linux-netdev, I
understand why you feel that way and I might also, if I were to read
these mails without knowing the people.  OTOH, I know Oliver and I
don't think it was his intention to disturb you or to push you to
integrate our code into the kernel without necessary changes being
done.  Some misunderstandings might be the result of infelicitous
formulations.  Unfortunately, I wasn't able to immediately answer on
the list to try to help the situation.

Also, we know that you do all the work voluntarily and we really value
that effort very well.  Really.  Actually, although we started that
project at our daytime job and I wouldn't have ever got in contact
with CAN without my job, we do much on it in our spare time, now.  I
don't like CAN but I know many people use it in embedded systems
running linux.  I therefore would like to have a good CAN
implementation in the linux kernel.  So our main goal is not to have
our code integrated into the kernel by all means as it might seem from
some mails on the list, but to provide the best implementation
possible and that's why I liked the feedback we got from the list.
Then, of course, we also try to get our code into the main kernel so
that more people can use it more easily.

I hope I could clarify some things, ease this trouble and we can still
work together.

&gt;<i> Why don't you guys just post your patches to netdev and make the
</I>&gt;<i> changes to the code and design being asked from you instead of
</I>&gt;<i> spending so much effort trying to argue against the things Patrick is
</I>&gt;<i> trying to tell you about your code and how the infrastructure is
</I>&gt;<i> designed?
</I>
Actually, that's what I have done.  I have posted patch series several
times and each time Oliver and I have integrated your suggestions to
the best of our knowledge/time, including the conversion of the vcan
driver to the RTNL API.

Since our last post we have done some further changes to meet changes
in APIs and on coding style, and I will post again today.

&gt;<i> All of which are totally reasonable and I absolutely agree
</I>&gt;<i> with, your device model is horrible and needs to be fixed up.
</I>
Hm, what do you mean by &quot;our device model&quot;?  Could you explain what
you think that still needs to be fixed?

Thanks,
urs
