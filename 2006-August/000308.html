</I>
That's a too narrow view. Those tasks that need predictable latencies
(practically) independent of what the rest of the Linux system does,
they benefit from the reduced complexity and different optimisation
goals of a co-scheduling system.

&gt;<i> Standard 2.6.x Linux kernel has reasonably good (O(1))
</I>&gt;<i> scheduler and many RT processes of applications can be written as small
</I>&gt;<i> statically linked code locked into memory. There are some results,
</I>&gt;<i> that fully preemptive kernel can guarantee maximal latencies for
</I>&gt;<i> highest priority task about 20 usec. I would be more pessimistic
</I>
20 us is marketing. -rt basically only works on x86[_64] ATM, and the
latencies you see on those platforms due to PC hardware are already in
the same order of magnitude.

&gt;<i> for now and I would expect, that 100-500 usec should not be problem
</I>&gt;<i> on many hardware setups in short while. But it is enough to ensure
</I>&gt;<i> correct trajectory planning for many robotic systems where 1 msec
</I>&gt;<i> is used in many cases. The jitter &lt; 500ms is not problem, because
</I>&gt;<i> CANopen process data confirmation can be synchronized by SYNC
</I>&gt;<i> message provided from some dedicated node for example.
</I>
Most discussions on what an -rt kernel may be able to provide generally
fail to take its overhead on non-rt jobs into account. And that numbers
vary between 20% and 400%.

&gt;<i> It would be significant lost if the proposed solution would not
</I>&gt;<i> aim to provide t least suitable latencioes for such setup.
</I>&gt;<i> I agree, that regular kernel would not be enough for software

</I>&gt;<i> tasks there should not be real problem if priority of IRQ
</I>&gt;<i> worker threads and RT tasks are defined well and there
</I>&gt;<i> is no blocker of messages flow. I have looked at Socket-CAN
</I>&gt;<i> and I see possibility of such problem there at this moment.
</I>&gt;<i> But I think, that it should be possible to overcome it
</I>&gt;<i> if per device queues are supported by Linux networking core.
</I>&gt;<i> Actual solution has another drawback, that CAN messages can be

</I>&gt;<i> block transfers (as an example) is many times more
</I>&gt;<i> difficult (requires sorting according to timestamps),
</I>&gt;<i> than if order is naturally preserved.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> As Jan was not sure if the Linux-networklayer can be driven correctly in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> RT-environments, the Socket-API was discussed and confirmed as common
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> sense between the 'normal' world and the RT-world. On this Socket-API
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> flavour the RT-Socket-CAN was implemented using other techniques than
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the Linux-networklayer to meet the RT-requirements (e.g. with
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> homemade-FIFOs instead of the standard-networklayer queueing).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I agree if this would not kill the area, where we and many
</I>&gt;<i> others like/need to use Linux CAN based systems.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> So from my opinion the ideas and solutions have been worked out very
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> clearly in the discussion and we are now at the point to discuss about
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> new CAN-protocols (within the PF_CAN) and how to realize the additional
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> requirements of some CAN-users with a standard-network-driver-interface
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> approach.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> E.g. if you like to send a sequence of can_frames we should discuss
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> about creating some kind of CAN_RAWSEQ protocol that allows to send
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> multiple frames at one syscall, or maybe we can just send multiple
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> CAN-Frames on the CAN_RAW-socket (which would be splitted up inside the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> RAW-socket). On the other hand regarding the network-interface for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> CAN-controllers there might be a discussion on CAN-drivers that create
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> more than one netdevice for one controller to meet the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> hardware-mailbox-filter-whatever-mechanism.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I think, that raw socket handling should be fast enough to
</I>&gt;<i> process messages one by one, but syscall overhead is not
</I>&gt;<i> so small, so I would vote for write/send/read/receive
</I>&gt;<i> to raw message to be able pass more messages on
</I>&gt;<i> one call to the kernel and then fill them into more
</I>&gt;<i> SKBs.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> So in my opinion RT-Socket-CAN and Socket-CAN (aka LLCF) address in some
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> cases different problems and solve it with different techniques under
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> one (mostly) common Socket-API. This makes this discussion that important.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> As Wolfgang stated in this thread some RT-implementations (e.g.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> CAN-drivers) are 'lighter' to meet latency issues and implementing some
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> kind of 'TX-queues-with-reordering' looks definitely like a task for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> RT-Socket-CAN.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I would suggest Pavel making some steps of testing with the 'standard'

Looks like a valid usage scenario to me that at least RT-Socket-CAN
would not handle gracefully right now. Having to schedule back to the
sender for each following frame is suboptimal.

&gt;<i> The most logical thing is to compute data and send them into
</I>&gt;<i> nonblocking CAN interface through one call. On the other hand,
</I>&gt;<i> I agree, that there could be some problem to deal with overload
</I>&gt;<i> in such case.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> We are preparing test setup and we have already compiled Socket-CAN

</I>&gt;<i> drivers which are no longer available in 2.6.17 kernels.
</I>&gt;<i> I am sending patch solving this problem. It is compatible with

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> We need to prepare board support for cards which we have
</I>&gt;<i> on test system and we try to run some tests during next weeks.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
If you are already on it, you may want to check-out latest Xenomai as
well: the CAN stack has been merged into trunk on Friday, all you need
to run it is contained.
