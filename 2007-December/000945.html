<PRE>Hi Chris,

Sorry for the delay but I had some problems in the SPI
interface of my board that seems to be solved now.

I am still testing the driver but till now I found the
following problems:

1. The clock passed to 'can.can_sys_clock' really should be
    divided by two and not four.
   (The comment in the source already showed some doubts...)

    ...
    priv-&gt;can.can_sys_clock = pdata-&gt;oscillator_frequency / 2;
    ...

2. To compensate for that, the value of the BRP configured
    in the controller should be the value returned by
    'can_calc_bittime()' minus one:

    ...
    mcp251x_write_reg(spi,
           CNF1, ((bt-&gt;std.sjw - 1) &lt;&lt; 6) | (bt-&gt;std.brp-1));
    ...

    The way things were they worked for rates such as 250K and 125K
    but not for 50K, 20K and 10K.

3. There is an error in the mask to clear the interrupt flags at the
    the end of the interrupt function. The correct value is:

    ...
    mcp251x_write_bits(spi, CANINTF,
          intf &amp; ~(CANINTF_RX0IF | CANINTF_RX1IF), 0x00);
    ...

    (CANINTF_RX1F was specified two times)

    Also, at the end of the interrupt function it does not seem
    necessary to read CANSTAT.

4. As another user already noticed, the SPI mode used must
    be 0 or 3. And I think the best place to configure it
    is in the spi_board_info structure and not in the driver.



I am having strange performance problems in the reception
that maybe specific to my architecture or not.

At the rate of 125K or more if I send from another system 4 or
more messages back to back to my board under test I got
overrun errors and lose some messages.

My SPI clock is 10Mhz so it takes only 0.8us to read a byte.
So to service a reception interrupt I expect to spend
approximately the following time with the SPI:

- read interrupt flags (3 bytes)
- read a complete message (15 bytes)
- clear interrupt flags(4 bytes)
- read interrupt flags again (3 bytes)

time = 25 * 0.8us = 20us


At the rate of 125K the interval in time between
two 8 bytes messages is approximately:

time = 8us * 115 bits = 920 us.

So the it seems to have plenty of time to process
the interrupt and not lose messages.
I am trying to change the interrupt service routine
to see if I can understand what is happening.
As I am experimenting with the driver source I
couldn't send you a patch and I only listed
the problems I found.


Best regards,
Claudio Leonel
