Hi Fernando,
thanks for your feedback, it's good to know somebody else works with
the same device ;-)
Status is this: I've got a patch that works with recent kernels.
Unfortunately it works, otherwise I'd be forced to work on it :-)
To be serious, there's some work to do until the driver meets the
requirements we've discussed on this list. As I presently need 200% of
my time for other stuff, it'll probably take some time. I still hope to
get the thing ready for the next merge window.
If you like to work on it, I could send you a patch that applies
against 2.6.25-rc1, feel free to improve it. Please tell me if you're
interested.

Thanks,
Hans
