Hi Marc,

Yes, you are right. My second patch probably is pretty broken!

Ok, that sounds like it's clearly more than your system can handle... at least 
with the unpatched driver.

&gt;<i> Without your patch the RX of a single message (dlc doesn't matter) takes

</I>
19..20 SPI interrupts? Sounds like the SPI driver could use some optimizing. 
The interrupts you get are probably due to the FIFO that wants more data. The 
controller probably generates an interrupt every time the FIFO has space for 
at least one byte, right?
Anyway, you should get 10 SPI transfers. Let me think.... 9 of the 10 
transfers are for less than 8 bytes. The SPI FIFO is 8-deep, so that should be 
9 SPI interrupts for 9 of the 10 transactions. One of the 10 transactions, 
however is 14 bytes long. Since the MX35 has an 8-deep FIFO, it's 8 bytes with 
1 interrupt and then 6 more bytes with one interrupt each.... yields 16 SPI 
interrupts in total, following my counts.
Hmm, I must be counting wrong.

&gt;<i> When trying to receive 6 messages I see something quite strange: The
</I>&gt;<i> CAN-ID should be always &quot;2&quot;, the dlc &quot;1&quot; and the data should be increasing.
</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The last frame looks quite broken. I haven't debugged the problem yet.
</I>
Broken or unreliable SPI, or spurious interrupts on your board is the only 
thing I can think of....
Are you using automatic Slave-Select, or GPIO? If you use automatic (internal) 
SS, there might be a chance SS goes inactive during the long (14-byte) message 
transfer. That could explain the excessive interrupts you get.
Does is get worse if you run some CPU-intensive task in the background?
I will try to reproduce your problem on my board, but I don't believe I will 
manage to get broken frames (never had so far), and I am using only GPIO-SS.

&gt;<i> I've done this test with the pengutronix's can-utils. On the sending side:
</I>&gt;<i> 	cansequence -p --loop=6
</I>&gt;<i> On the rx side:
</I>&gt;<i> 	candump
</I>
Unfortunately our test equipment runs on Xenomai RT-SocketCAN, so your tool 
would need some porting before I can run it. But our system is python-
scriptable, so maybe if you explain what &quot;cansequence -p --loop=6&quot; does....?

&gt;<i> With your patch it's 8 interrupts per message. And with the improvement
</I>&gt;<i> you talked about on the phone, i.e. 2515 clears the RX flag
</I>&gt;<i> automatically, I managed to get it down to 7. But I get still this
</I>&gt;<i> strage 8 byte long can message, although it takes much more messages to
</I>&gt;<i> trigger that problem.
</I>
Ok, at least my patch improves things ;-P

But again, counting SPI interrupts I can't exactly explain this. Can't you 
count SPI transactions or SPI-SS pulses?
IIRC, with my first patch you should have 4 SPI transactions per CAN-frame, 
and probably 1 less when removing the while() in the CAN ISR, but I am not 
sure if it is safe to do.
