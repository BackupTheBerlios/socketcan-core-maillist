</I>
Ah, OK, now I remember better what's going on. The &quot;cannetdriver&quot;
behaves significantly different in that respect.

&gt;<i> I think the intention of the original author was to put the bus into sleep 
</I>&gt;<i> mode first which, under normal conditions, gracefully finishes ongoing 
</I>&gt;<i> transactions. However, when there is a bus problem, a write transaction 
</I>
Yes, and that also the recommended procedure to put the controller into
the init mode (according to the MPC5200 user manual).

&gt;<i> may never finish and a mode switch will never get through. And even worth 
</I>&gt;<i> even if the bus gets operable again this state will not recover 
</I>&gt;<i> automaticly, it is required to abort all transfers (like in the patch you 
</I>&gt;<i> sent) or reset the mscan engine (which happens if the sleep mode setting 
</I>&gt;<i> error is ignored). 
</I>
Yep, and that's what my patch is doing.

&gt;<i> And, BTW, shouldn't the mode switching been protected somehow ??
</I>
I have to check, but as this is almost obsolete code, it might not be
worth the effort.

&gt;<i> And another problem: our customer used the CAN START/STOP IOCTL, even 
</I>&gt;<i> though not needed, right after opening / before closing the raw socket. 
</I>&gt;<i> This leads to endless Tx timeouts after the program has terminated. I'm 
</I>&gt;<i> not realy sure what happens here, but a simple solution to this may be to 
</I>&gt;<i> track the current state of the driver and simply ignore such requests if 
</I>&gt;<i> they do not change the state (and honour the state on internal mode 
</I>&gt;<i> switches). I saw there is already some state tracking in the cannetdriver 
</I>&gt;<i> version, but it seems to be work in progress ? 
</I>
The IOCTL interface and TX netdev timeouts have been removed in
&quot;cannetdriver&quot;. Please use the &quot;cannetdriver&quot; and see, if the behavior
is OK for you. This would really help us progressing further with the
new CAN device interface.

&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Just a (may be stupid) question: shouldn't there be any error frames for 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> an error like a cable break ?? Or is this not supported by the mscan driver 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> ?? 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> It should create error frames when the state changes to the warning and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> error passive state. What do you get with:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   $ candump -e 0xffff any
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The controller will not go bus-off in that case.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'll try this later on today, just busy with some other things. 
</I>
Thanks.

Wolfgang.
