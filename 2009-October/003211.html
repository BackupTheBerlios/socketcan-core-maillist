I just looked into it. It seems like MDIO is a kind of serial bus (like
I2C) that can have more PHY's on 1 bus, and every PHY have more
registers. This is way more complex than what I know from CAN.

The CAN chips itself imply a series of link monitoring (busoff etc) inside
the CAN chip. only a few options live outside (shortcircuit
detection etc).
I think this eliminitas the bigger interaction models as seen between
PHY &amp; ethernet devices.
An interface would be limited to exposing some properties (max baudrate)
   at open_candev(), an 'enable()/disable()' hook.
If I imagine a complex CAN transceiver, I'd implement another
platform_device, using some GPIO's, ....
The hard thing is finding the right transceiver for the right CAN chip,
but I see no elegant solution for that in the PHY infrastructure.

Nevertheless, I feel I'm not the only one having a GPIO for enabling the
dumb 82C251 (my hardware colleague was proud telling it saves XX mA when
off), so a more centralised approach could be interesting.

I'll need to give this some time :-)
