</I>&gt;<i>         ;
</I>&gt;<i>         spin_unlock(&amp;lock);
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> which is buggy because of the kmalloc() while holding the lock.  I
</I>&gt;<i> haven't found any alternative that completely satisfies me.  I have
</I>&gt;<i> thought abount the following:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> (..)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 4. Abandon the list completely and put the struct dev_rcv_lists into
</I>&gt;<i>    struct can_device, thus eliminating the need for dynamically
</I>&gt;<i>    allocated memory for this struct and for scanning the list to find
</I>&gt;<i>    the required device.
</I>This sounds very good, but indeed ...
&gt;<i>   But that means that all CAN interface
</I>&gt;<i>    implementations *have* to use the struct can_device in the priv
</I>&gt;<i>    pointer and that bind(2) on a PF_CAN socket has to ensure that the
</I>&gt;<i>    specified device is indeed a CAN device which has a associated
</I>&gt;<i>    struct can_device.  This could probably best be done by checking it
</I>&gt;<i>    has ARPHDR_CAN of the device.  The bad smell of this solution is
</I>&gt;<i>    that the priv data of a netdevice become not so private anymore
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>Yep! This is my major concern as the CAN-netdevice would hold data that 
references to socket-callback functions that are used in the 
network-layer. And this is quite far away from private netdevice data ...
&gt;<i>    (which we already have anyway since we use the priv pointer to
</I>&gt;<i>    point to struct can_device to hold common data for CAN interfaces).
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>Hm, but the information currently hold by the struct can_device is 
definitely associated to CAN netdevices (baudrates, statistics, etc) and 
does not have data that's needed by anyone else. The interface to the 
network-layer is defined by ETH_P_CAN and ARPHRD_CAN - and i don't know, 
if the suggested mixing would be 'kernel political' correct. But i would 
have some new performance increasing ideas in mind, if the receive-lists 
would go into the CAN netdevices ... so i might be vulnerable to your 
idea ;-]

Maybe we should discuss this face to face next week. Thinking about your 
suggestion, i realized a new question what should be done with 
receive-list-entries, if an interface is going down / the kernel-module 
is being unloaded ...

Best regards,

Oliver
