Yes. So far it looks like that only SMP systems are affected. As obviously the
command register is the only register that is unfortunately used in the hot
path at receiving AND sending CAN frames i tend to adopt the strict locking
suggested by Klaus.

What about an updated patch with a dedicated function for writing the command
register, which executes a different locking depending on CONFIG_SMP.

Would this be ok for you?

Regards,
Oliver
