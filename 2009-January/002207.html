</I>
Yes, I also came to that conclusion. Git has nowadays a rather good
interactive re-base facility but I find quilt still more straight
forward. And exporting a public GIT repo which gets often re-based is
also not nice for the user.

&gt;<i> When the patches are ready for inclusion in net.git then
</I>&gt;<i> you could switch to git.
</I>
Yep.

&gt;<i> But this again also depends on your userbase.
</I>&gt;<i> For kbuild my userbase is small and I can rebase

</I>&gt;<i> For can-drv.git it may look different since you

</I>
Currently the source and base for development is the SVN repo and they
may need it for older kernel versions as well. It's not always simple to
switch to the latest kernel version.

&gt;<i> Btw. another reason to start out early with git is that integration
</I>&gt;<i> in -next is a simple matter of asking Stephen to pull your tree and
</I>&gt;<i> you then get far better build coverage.
</I>
Yes, that's obvious.

Wolfgang.
