<PRE>Hi Wolfgang,

&gt;<i> what is your plan now? Provide patches for mainline inclusion
</I>&gt;<i> (net-next-2.6) or for the Socket-CAN SVN trunk? Please don't send
</I>&gt;<i> patches for both. We can do the backport to the SVN trunk later.
</I>
Okay, I didn't know that this was acceptable. I thought we get the driver
straight first in socketcan-trunk and then put it to net-next. From the
development process, I'd like it a _lot_ more if I just could create my
git-branch and then post to the according mailing-lists, like ppc and netdev. I
didn't really dare to do this for this first round, as I didn't know who is
working on what and if there are already other plans for mscan and I didn't
want to interfere.

&gt;<i> &gt; Note 1: It depends on changes to the clock-implementation of the MPC512x.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Those patches need to be discussed and approved on the ppc list and can be found here:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; <A HREF="http://patchwork.ozlabs.org/patch/37417/">http://patchwork.ozlabs.org/patch/37417/</A>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; <A HREF="http://patchwork.ozlabs.org/patch/37427/">http://patchwork.ozlabs.org/patch/37427/</A>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (If they work for you, I'd be happy about Acked-by-tags.)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> My impression is that they will not be accepted as already a new clock
</I>&gt;<i> interface is available (via patches).
</I>
As those patches you mentioned are in an early state, I think my additions
could be accepted for now. Also, for the mpc5xxx_can-part, there shouldn't be
much change, as it is still clk_get() and clk_enable() there.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Note 2: If this approach is accepted, I will next do the remaining cleanup
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; work (giving the functions the proper 5xxx names, ...) as follow up patches to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; hopefully get this driver into mainline soonish.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Would be nice to have that fixed a.s.a.p.
</I>
Yeah, in case I can use git and a the top-of-tree kernel version, this should
go more smoothly.

</I>&gt;<i> I assume this patch is for the SVN trunk. Please provide patches against
</I>&gt;<i> top of tree, and not a subdirectory to ease testing.
</I>
Uh, ouch! I'm very sorry, seems like my svn-fu has dramatically dropped since git.

&gt;<i> &gt; Index: mscan/mpc52xx_can.c
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> As said above, please do s/mpc52xx/mpc5xxx/ immediately. It does not
</I>&gt;<i> harm if we have both, the old mpc52xx_can.c and the new mpc5xxx_can.c
</I>&gt;<i> in the SVN trunk including the related CONFIG_CAN_* parameters. The
</I>&gt;<i> mpc5xxx_can.c should not include the legacy driver stuff (pre-OF), of
</I>&gt;<i> course.
</I>
OK.

&gt;<i> &gt; +	cellp = of_get_property(ofdev-&gt;node, &quot;cell-index&quot;, NULL);
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; +	if (!cellp)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; +		return 0;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Hm, the mscan node does not have a cell-index any more because it's
</I>&gt;<i> deprecated (removed by the device tree police), IIRC.
</I>
Using Grant's suggestion, this becomes obsolete.

&gt;<i> &gt; +	if (port_clk)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; +		return clk_get_rate(port_clk);
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; +	else
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; +		return clk_get_rate(mscan_clk);
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; +}
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I have not looked into your clock patches, but how can the user select
</I>&gt;<i> the clock source and the clock frequency (via clock divider)? This
</I>&gt;<i> should be selectable via DTS file, I think.
</I>
This is not possible yet. For that, I wanted to wait until the
clock-representation in the device-tree (the patches you mentioned, I suppose)
stabilizes. If this matures, we can add the proper way to do it. For now,
&quot;clock-ipb&quot; is supported, the rest has to be done by the bootloader or
additional patches. I wouldn't like to introduce &quot;intermediate&quot; properties to
the device tree.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> What's also missing is the proper bus-off recovery method for the
</I>&gt;<i> MCP512x. Unfortunately, it's also not yet OK for the MPC5200. It should
</I>&gt;<i> be implemented as listed below:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> - if possible, automatic bus-off recovery should be turned off, which
</I>&gt;<i>   is possible on the MPC512x (but not the default for compatibility with
</I>&gt;<i>   the MPC5200.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> - if bus-off recovery cannot be switched of, the driver should handle it
</I>&gt;<i>   as follows:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>   - if restart_ms == 0, the device should be stopped on bus-off to
</I>&gt;<i>     suppress automatic recovery.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>   - if restart_ms &gt; 0, the hardware should do the automatic recovery and
</I>&gt;<i>     a RESTARTED error message should be sent when it re-enters the
</I>&gt;<i>     error-active state (or leaves the bus-off state).
</I>
Uh, I didn't find this in the TODO. That might beat my timeframe for this
project, as it surely needs lots of testing :( Maybe Fu can help me here, but
not sure...

Thanks for the feedback!
