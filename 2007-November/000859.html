Hm. Do you exactly know what the user wants? The CAN just moved to be a 
multi-user concept on your linux box. I admit that it has to be possible 
to define an instance (e.g. a daemon) that controls the several CAN 
interfaces in the system and makes whatever you want. But it has to be 
possible to write an application that's only interested in data not 
regarding any lower bus specific problems. We need to abstract from deep 
controller hacking and from being the *only* application on the host ...

&gt;&gt;<i> In case
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of bus-off the driver shall stop the CAN and inform the user space.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It should behave like Ethernet when you pull the cable. You notice it

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>
This is already done. There are Error frames defined that inform the 
user about problems on driver level. Some are already implemented in the 
sja1000 driver from Wolfgang (see patch [3/10]). You can set a filter in 
the RAW socket to get error frames if you like. Example:

<A HREF="http://svn.berlios.de/svnroot/repos/socketcan/trunk/test/tst-err.c">http://svn.berlios.de/svnroot/repos/socketcan/trunk/test/tst-err.c</A>

<A HREF="http://svn.berlios.de/svnroot/repos/socketcan/trunk/kernel/2.6/include/linux/can/error.h">http://svn.berlios.de/svnroot/repos/socketcan/trunk/kernel/2.6/include/linux/can/error.h</A>

So you can already get much closer to CAN specific problems than in the 
ethernet case!

&gt;&gt;<i> The application may decide if to restart the CAN (over ioctl). There
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> shall be also a possibility to purge Tx queue before restarting the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> CAN.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It might be cleaner to simply require the application to close and
</I>&gt;<i> reopen the socket.
</I>
Urgs! This is networking and not chardev CAN hacking! Who should close 
and reopen the socket? Every application? Really bad.

We had intensive discussions over transparency of CAN problems the last 
two years and found solutions to provide a networking style approach as 
you know from other networking families AND the transparency you need to 
work on CAN details.

The automatic recovery from BUS OFF had been discussed also. E.g. in 
automotive environments you need to restart your controller after a 
specified time (e.g. after 200ms). There is no one that says: &quot;Oh, it's 
bus off. I lay down and die.&quot; You need to recover.

Of course there may be a use-case where automatic recovery is not 
wanted. But therefore it should be configurable. Not every 
application/use-case want's to be aware of these details.

This was much information. Please check out the currently (well) defined 
mechanics before thinking of closing and re-opening sockets ...

Regards,
Oliver
