OK, perfect.

OK, I know.

&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> will be fine. If I find a need for switching off termination later
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> (unlikely) then I'll add a sysfs attribute.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> That is a bad idea. You must use termination if the controller is at one

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'll get the rest of the driver working before I worry about this.
</I>
This could also be disabled via module parameters.
[snip]
&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I used NAPI to process CAN frames only.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> OK.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I could remove NAPI support and roll the functionality into the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> workqueue, if you think that would be better.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> NAPI support is a good thing in general but having it in the work queue
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> seems more straight forward and you could get rid of a lot of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> synchronization, I assume. But that's just a wild guess for the moment.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It is easy enough to implement. I'll do that for the next posting of the
</I>&gt;<i> driver.
</I>
But only if it does simplify the code significantly.

[snip]
&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Do you have ideas of how to do this without any indication of &quot;fullness&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> from the hardware?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> You could at least restrict the number of messages queued. Does the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> firmware provide a TX done notification?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Nope. If there is mention of it in the manual, I cannot find it. :(
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I *do* have a notification mechanism if I don't support EFF CAN frames,
</I>&gt;<i> but I'd really like to have support for that.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I could read the entire ring off the device after each xmit() and see if
</I>&gt;<i> it is full. But then I have no way of knowing when to start the queue
</I>&gt;<i> again, unless I set a kernel timer and keep reading the ring. That is a
</I>&gt;<i> terribly slow (and ugly) approach, though.
</I>
Yep. It will not be possible to support all the functionality with an
intelligent card. There are some restrictions.

[snip]
&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I thought the can_(get|put)_echo_skb() functionality was the Linux CAN
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> layer software fallback. Am I wrong?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> No.
</I>
Hm, is my answer not clear. You implementation is *OK*.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Ok, I'll try and figure out what these do. The comments in the code
</I>&gt;<i> /really/ make it seem like these are for local loopback. The
</I>&gt;<i> descriptions even talk about local loopback! A better description might
</I>&gt;<i> help authors such as myself.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>From drivers/net/can/dev.c:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> /*
</I>&gt;<i>  * Get the skb from the stack and loop it back locally
</I>&gt;<i>  *
</I>&gt;<i>  * The function is typically called when the TX done interrupt
</I>&gt;<i>  * is handled in the device driver. The driver must protect
</I>&gt;<i>  * access to priv-&gt;echo_skb, if necessary.
</I>&gt;<i>  */
</I>&gt;<i> void can_get_echo_skb(struct net_device *dev, unsigned int idx)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> /*
</I>&gt;<i>  * Put the skb on the stack to be looped backed locally lateron
</I>&gt;<i>  *
</I>&gt;<i>  * The function is typically called in the start_xmit function
</I>&gt;<i>  * of the device driver. The driver must protect access to
</I>&gt;<i>  * priv-&gt;echo_skb, if necessary.
</I>&gt;<i>  */
</I>&gt;<i> void can_put_echo_skb(struct sk_buff *skb, struct net_device *dev,
</I>&gt;<i>                       unsigned int idx)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
As I said. There is *no* need to do the loopback in software (by using
these functions) if the hardware already does it. But then you should
use also &quot;0&quot; for the echo skb size in the following call:

	ndev = alloc_candev(sizeof(*mod), 0);

Wolfgang.
