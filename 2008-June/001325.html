Right, I thought that was the reasoning behind the way I described
earlier in this thread. But have to re-read the other thread first...

Configuring the bitrate is something which is usually done at &quot;ifup&quot;
time, so having a &quot;canconfig&quot; tool to do things in userspace is not
generally a no-no. But I agree with Hans that directly feeding some
device independend parameter set into the kernel is much better.

We had lots of discussions with CAN people before Juergen implemented
that interface, and it turned out that it represents a way that

- can be implemented easily in a driver
- makes it possible to get standard conformant bitrate deviations
- offers an easy way to set just &quot;the&quot; bitrate (using a table
  internally)
- seems to fulfill anything needed by non-sja-type controllers
- uses a model which comes directly from the CAN standard and thus is
  well understood by CAN people
