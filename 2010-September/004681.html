Hi Chrisitian,

I am posting this on the socketcan-core list.

On Friday 24 September 2010 10:41:15 am christian pellegrin wrote:
&gt;<i> &gt; 1.- The MCP2515 driver (from current mainline linux) makes quite a lot of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; SPI transfers from inside the ISR. I counted 10 SPI-transfers for each
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; CAN message sent or received. This can be reduced a lot. For instance,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the INTF and EFLG registers can be read and cleard both in just two
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; transactions. Also, if the second receive buffer isn't filled, there is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; no need to first clear the interrupt flag of buffer 0 and then clear them
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; all in two separate transactions.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> nice idea, but have you checked that this works on mcp2510 too? (I
</I>&gt;<i> think it has a reduced instruction set on SPI).
</I>
Yes, that part should be no problem for the MCP2510, since it also supports 
automatic address increase.

&gt;<i> &gt; 2.- Only one of the three available TX-boxes is used. This makes the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; driver simple, but performance is less than it could be for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; transmit-bursts. Essentially a message is put into the TX-box, and the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; netif-queue is stopped, then the message is sent, an interrupt is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; generated, SPI transactions occur to service the interrupt, and only then
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; is the netif queue re-enabled. This introduces a delay between two
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; consecutive CAN messages. In my patch below, I implemented a (very dirty)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; hack to enable the use of two TX-boxes, and now the driver is able to use
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the full bandwidth of a 250kbaud link.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> have you checked that there aren't out of order transmission problems?
</I>
No, and yes, there most probably are out of order transmission problems. I 
just want to make clear that patch 1. was meant to be implemented as is, since 
I am pretty confident that it works, but patch 2. is meant only as RFC. It is 
known to be broken in several ways.

&gt;<i> &gt; 1.- When just started the interface, a few of the first CAN messages to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; arrive are being discarded, because of some strange race condition (I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; have NOHZ enabled). I get the following kenel messages (10 times):
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  NOHZ: local_softirq_pending 08
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I see the same message on my laptop to which I connected an external
</I>&gt;<i> (USB) ISDN adapter. A quick question to google showed me this:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://patchwork.ozlabs.org/patch/33630/">http://patchwork.ozlabs.org/patch/33630/</A> which can be related.
</I>
Interesting. I haven't checked, but either this patch isn't in mainline yet 
(one year later), or this isn't the same problem...

&gt;<i> &gt; 2.- The second problem was introduced by my hacks, and I am currently
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; investigating why this occurs: If the system is heavily loaded, I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; sometimes get the following error message (no CAN-messages are lost):
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  mcp251x spi0.2: hard_xmit called while tx busy
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I have carefully checked the conditions when the netif-queue is started
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and stopped, and have yet to discover why this message gets printed.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I had just a quick glance at your patch but this seem possible for the
</I>&gt;<i> sequence:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> mcp251x_hard_start_xmit -&gt; tx_skb full, tx_busy_mask 0
</I>&gt;<i> mcp251x_tx_work_handler -&gt; tx_skb free, tx_busy_mask 1
</I>&gt;<i> mcp251x_hard_start_xmit -&gt; tx_skb full, tx_busy_mask 1
</I>&gt;<i> mcp251x_tx_work_handler -&gt; tx_skb free, tx_busy_mask 3
</I>&gt;<i> mcp251x_can_ist -&gt; tx_skb free, tx_busy_mask 2
</I>&gt;<i> mcp251x_hard_start_xmit -&gt; tx_skb full, tx_busy_mask 2
</I>&gt;<i> mcp251x_can_ist -&gt; tx_skb full, tx_busy_mask 0
</I>&gt;<i> mcp251x_hard_start_xmit -&gt; has tx_skb at the beginning full so the
</I>&gt;<i> warning you reported
</I>
Hmmm. So I guess we do need an extra skb (I wanted to avoid that), or change 
the end of the ISR from:

		netif_wake_queue(net);

to:

		if (!priv-&gt;tx_skb)
			netif_wake_queue(net);

But in that case, I need to check if there isn't a scenario where the netif-
queue stays stopped forever... I'll try this later.

&gt;<i> please check this sequence carefully since I could be mistaken.
</I>
I guess you are right.

Best regards,
