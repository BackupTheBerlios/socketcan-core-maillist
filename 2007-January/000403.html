<PRE>Hello Wolfgang,

first of all thanks to your review. There had been indeed some unfunny 
things like

-	release_mem_region(mem-&gt;start, mem-&gt;start - mem-&gt;end + 1);
+	release_mem_region(mem-&gt;start, mem-&gt;end - mem-&gt;start + 1);

inside  ... :-/

 From my side there are no objections for your patch.

ACK.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> CAN protocol and SJA1000:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - &quot;net/can/dev.c&quot; can be built as module and should therefore have the
</I>&gt;<i>   usual module definitions, like MODULE_AUTHOR, MODULE_LICENSE, etc.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>ACK.
&gt;<i> - &quot;net/can/Kconfig&quot;: I think &quot;source drivers/net/can/Kconfig&quot; should
</I>&gt;<i>   go to &quot;drivers/net/Kconfig&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>ACK.
&gt;<i> - I think there should be a &quot;drivers/can/&lt;controller&gt;/Kconfig&quot; for each
</I>&gt;<i>   controller.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Hm. Looking under driver/net/xxx/? there is mostly no additional 
subdirectory structure for the different (ethernet-/decnet-/...) 
controllers. Maybe drivers/net/can is really enough for us.
&gt;<i> - I think the Makefiles could be simplified.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Yes - especially if we would have a flat directory structure here 
Suggestions?
&gt;<i> - &quot;drivers/can/sja1000/Makefile&quot;:
</I>&gt;<i>   o CONFIG_CAN_SJA1000 is not used.
</I>Belongs to the cleanup ...
&gt;<i>   o the SJA1000 driver cannot be statically linked into the kernel.
</I>:<i>-/
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - It seems, that the diver of the SJA1000 controller is bundled with the
</I>&gt;<i>   board specific driver, e.g. it is currently not possible to use it for
</I>&gt;<i>   more than one SJA1000 device type at a time. Have I missed something?
</I>&gt;<i>   I think there should be a kernel driver module for the SJA1000
</I>&gt;<i>   controller on one for each SJA1000 device type.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Hm - there is a sja1000-mem.ko sja1000-gw2.ko sja1000-xxx.ko generated 
for each different board. I think it should be already like you suggested.

&gt;<i> - Missing features in the SJA1000 driver:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   o Various SIO[SG]* settings for baudrate, mode and controller-mode.
</I>&gt;<i>     They can be implemented as for MSCAN. The infrastructure in dev.c is
</I>&gt;<i>     already available. Note that &quot;set_baud&quot; in sja1000.c is than
</I>&gt;<i>     obsolete.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Yep - i know. I can hopefully take a look on this in the next week.
&gt;<i> - Sooner than later a kernel patch for socketcan is required. I think
</I>&gt;<i>   the simplest way is to provide a script to add socketcan to the kernel
</I>&gt;<i>   and generate a patch.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Yes. That's also my pracmatical intention. Maybe Urs can take a look on 
this, when he's back from holiday.
&gt;<i> - Further comments:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   o A common naming scheme for the modules would be nice, also for the
</I>&gt;<i>     drivers, e.g. can-sja1000-isa.ko, can-mscan-mpc5200.ko.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Nice idea - but i would like to wait for other driver classes inside the 
Kernel doing an analogue naming convention. The module names are getting 
really long which is currently not usual. See lsmod ...

&gt;<i>   o The bit timing calculation in dev.c does not return the usual BTR0/1
</I>&gt;<i>     values for the SJA1000, e.g. BTR0 = 0x03, BTR1 = 0x1C for 125 KB/s.
</I>&gt;<i>     This might be confusing. In RT-Socket-CAN I use a different method
</I>&gt;<i>     to calculate BTR0 and BTR1 (actually the one from the PCAN driver).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>I am not that deep in BTR calculations. There is also a code to do this 
in sja1000.c (which i think is from Matthias Brukner). I did not use the 
calculation from candev.ko as i wanted to wait for this discussion first.

I have more concerns on the definition of the 'can_device' and all the 
ND2CAN and CAN2ND macros. I'm not sure if this is really what it should 
look like in the kernel. Anyone here to convince me to have a 
can_device? What becomes easier for the programmer using it?

Best regards,
Oliver
