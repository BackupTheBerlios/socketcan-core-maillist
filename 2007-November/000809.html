<PRE>Hi Oliver,

I'm pleased to hear that the Socket-CAN core will make it finally into
2.6.25. Great work, thanks a lot.

Well, there's still plenty of work ;-).

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> As you stated some more times before the current drivers are not kernel

</I>&gt;<i> i'm a complete newbie in PHYs and platform stuff :-/
</I>
Yes.

&gt;&gt;<i>From what i've seen and understood right now, the new AT91 driver from
</I>&gt;<i> Hans-Juergen looks very nice to me.
</I>
I don't think it's a good example because it does not use the common CAN
device interface. We need a driver as reference and I think it should be
the one for the SJA1000.

&gt;<i> Btw. i have some RFCs about the new and old CAN netdrivers. The current
</I>&gt;<i> SVN CAN sore supports older kernels (at least down to 2.6.16 i would bet
</I>&gt;<i> :) So the question would be:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Should the *new* created netdrivers support older kernels (like 2.6.16)
</I>&gt;<i> or should they start from 2.6.24 and newer as long as they are not part
</I>&gt;<i> of the Kernel? The *current* (old) drivers in the SVN could stay there
</I>&gt;<i> analogue to the CAN core both supporting also older kernels.
</I>
For the time being I would continue with the SVN based development and
focus on refining and completing the CAN device interface and API and
driver implementation.

&gt;<i> Should we use a different revision control system or a git for the CAN
</I>&gt;<i> netdriver development? SVN is fine for me as it works through
</I>&gt;<i> http-proxies. Should we create a branch for driver development? And if
</I>&gt;<i> we go for a different system like git for the drivers - who could host &amp;
</I>&gt;<i> maintain it? Questions over questions ...
</I>&gt;<i> The SVN and the possibility of external(!) compilation turned out to be
</I>&gt;<i> a very good approach to me in the past.
</I>
When we start the inclusion of the CAN device interface and drivers, I
think it makes sense to switch to git.

Concerning next steps. We finally re-wrote the Socket-CAN driver for the
SJA1000. It's basically your (VW) driver using the existing CAN device
interface. It could be a good starting point, especially because it
implements most of the API we discussed long time ago, including error
frame generation. Nevertheless, there are various issues with the device
interface and it needs refinement and re-discussion.

What do you think?

Wolfgang.
