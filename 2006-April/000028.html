<PRE>Hi Wolfgang,


&gt;<i> E.g., MSCAN does not report most of the errors above. Therefore we may 
</I>&gt;<i> also distinguish between general/common errors, like bus-off, and 
</I>&gt;<i> controller specific errors.
</I>
Yes of course we should define a superset of errors that are known to happen
in CAN-controllers and on CAN-busses. I was additionally thinking on
CAN-transceiver problems that can occur with fault tolerant CAN-tranceivers
like the TJA1054:

/* operating status of CAN-transceiver */
#define TRXSTATUS_OK                 0x000
#define TRXSTATUS_SLEEP              0x001
#define TRXSTATUS_CANH_NO_WIRE       0x002
#define TRXSTATUS_CANH_SHORT_TO_BAT  0x004
#define TRXSTATUS_CANH_SHORT_TO_VCC  0x008
#define TRXSTATUS_CANH_SHORT_TO_GND  0x010
#define TRXSTATUS_CANL_NO_WIRE       0x020
#define TRXSTATUS_CANL_SHORT_TO_BAT  0x040
#define TRXSTATUS_CANL_SHORT_TO_VCC  0x080
#define TRXSTATUS_CANL_SHORT_TO_GND  0x100
#define TRXSTATUS_CANL_SHORT_TO_CANH 0x200

I was putting this into my (currently unused) can_ioctl.h but after this
error discussion we should check where it really belongs to (maybe
can_error.h?) and how it should really look like.

It seems that we have three classes of possible errors:

- physical layer errors (with the transceivers)
- CAN-protocol errors (CRC, bit-stuffing, etc)
- controller internal errors (overflows, error levels, bus-off, etc)

Any additional ideas?



&gt;&gt;<i> In the Volkswagen specifications the bus-off state causes a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> re-initialisation of the controller after 50ms (the first time) and 200ms
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (the following times). So if we assume all can-drivers behave like this
</I>(do
&gt;&gt;<i> we?) and the auto-repair functionality works, the bus-off state remains a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> serious problem on the CAN that has to be announced to the user.
</I>
&gt;<i> I realized the bus-off-recovery code in the socket-can drivers and asked 
</I>&gt;<i> myself, if this is always the intended behavior (or should the 
</I>&gt;<i> application handle it).
</I>
Hm i think you do not have this detailed problem-handling and application
information in other network-drivers in the kernel because you would always
need at least ONE application, that handles a network-problem that can be
easily solved within the driver. But it is definitely important, that the
application gets informed on these problems to react on application issues.

 
&gt;&gt;<i> So my suggestion ist, that the can-driver sends an error frame with a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> bus-off error type and the (raw, bcm, tpxxx) socket returns a -ENOMEDIUM
</I>to
&gt;&gt;<i> the user.
</I>
&gt;<i> No (..) 
</I>&gt;<i> The read, recvfrom, etc. should return the number of bytes returned into 
</I>&gt;<i> buf. The application should then check CAN_ERR_FLAG and react accordingly.
</I>
Sorry i was a bit unclear here. I mixed up the RAW-sockets requirements and
the higher level protocol sockets:

I thought on sockets for transport-protocols and the broadcast-manager that
are typically not dealing with 'repairable' CAN-errors. If we classify the
bus-off as something 'repairable' (where i'm currently tending to) the
'higher level' protocols should detect their errors only on their own
timeouts. So if an application want's to deal with any kind of
'CAN-problems' you have to open an (additional) RAW-socket and get this
information from there.


&gt;<i> I think it would also be nice, if the error frames could be disabled via 
</I>&gt;<i> socket or filter option (or enabled).
</I>
As you can have multiple raw_filters on one socket (that may contradict) it
is the best solution to define an extra socket option. Maybe there should be
some error filter possibility in the setsockopt() also as mentioned before:

- physical layer errors (with the transceivers)
- CAN-protocol errors (CRC, bit-stuffing, etc)
- controller internal errors (overflows, error levels, bus-off, etc)

What is your opinion for the default behaviour? Should all errors come
through the RAW-socket by default OR should we have to enable the errors by
hand?

Greetings,

Oliver
