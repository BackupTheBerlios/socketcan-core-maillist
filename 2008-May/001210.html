<PRE>Hi Hans.

&gt;<i> I know. But with the increasing speed of kernel development we saw quite
</I>&gt;<i> a few maintainers trying to decrease their workload. Jean Delvare gave
</I>&gt;<i> lm-sensors to Mark Hoffman and was looking for an i2c co-maintainer.
</I>&gt;<i> Greg KH dropped PCI maintainership. x86 has three maintainers.
</I>
Part of the above is natural evolution but yes - being maintainer
on one of the bigger subsystems are though work.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> CAN seems to be a very small subsystem at a first glance. But I think
</I>&gt;<i> bringing CAN drivers to mainline will be a lot of work for a maintainer,
</I>&gt;<i> let alone the maintenance work that'll come up after people started
</I>&gt;<i> using these drivers.
</I>
The maintainer shall more play the role as gatekeeper and competent
reviewer. If someone would like to see a specific driver in mainline
they should be willing to invest some time in it.
And the reviewer role should be spread out - we can all do our
share and the maintainer may even trust some of us to do a good
enough job here.
So to me maintainer dops not equal &quot;do a lot of coding&quot;.
ut that siad this is often the case.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> AFAICT, there's nobody ATM who will be paid for socketcan maintainer
</I>&gt;<i> work. That's why I voted for splitting responsibility between two or three
</I>&gt;<i> people. But I agree that it's not our major problem ATM. SocketCAN could
</I>&gt;<i> start with one maintainer, we'll soon enough find out if it works or
</I>&gt;<i> not.
</I>
Core stuff should have one person IMHO.
The driver can have individual maintainers but a single gatekeeper is still
preferable.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> My main concern is transparency. If a developer starts work, he should
</I>&gt;<i> know against which tree he should build his patches. After the patch was
</I>&gt;<i> discussed and accepted on the mailing list, it should be absolutely
</I>&gt;<i> clear what happens next, e.g. who will apply the patch to which tree,
</I>&gt;<i> and when will it hit mainline. I had some bad experiences with the ARM
</I>&gt;<i> tree in the past where an accepted patch disappeared in who-knows-who's
</I>&gt;<i> tree until a crippled not-functional version of my patch showed up in
</I>&gt;<i> mainline three month later... (I must add that they've improved
</I>&gt;<i> their workflow meanwhile)
</I>
SocketCAN are trivial compared to ARM and thus the processes around
it can be much simpler. But indeed it is preferable to have transparency here.
