</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> to keep the discussions about the magic of bitrate calculation away from
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> netdev ML ;-)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Thinking more about it, it would also simplify the API and the kernel
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> code. A tool for calculating bit timing parameters could be added to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> can-utils. What is needed from the driver is the CAN system clock and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the CAN controller type. In the SYSFS we have already &quot;can_sys_clock&quot;,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> but &quot;can_type&quot; is missing.
</I>&gt;<i> I have several objections on it. :-)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I don't want a tool in the userspace which must be aware of any controller
</I>&gt;<i> and controller type and the way the bitrate is calculated.
</I>
You don't need the tools as long as you are happy with the default
settings, either calculated by a small function or table. That's what we
should provide for non-experts in any case.

&gt;<i> The specific controller driver (e.g. SJA1000) already knows the hardware
</I>&gt;<i> (incl. controller clock from the specific device driver), it knows how the
</I>&gt;<i> bittiming register is build up out of the bitrate parameters (sample
</I>&gt;<i> point, ...). Why don't we let the controller do it?
</I>
Because sophisticated calculations should not be done in kernel space
and also be aware of the maintenance impact. It's always a big effort to
get patches upstream.

&gt;<i> The SYSFS module provides a predefined table of common bitrates and the
</I>&gt;<i> parameters (_not_ the btregs).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> cat can_bitrates
</I>&gt;<i> # bitrate bittime ...
</I>&gt;<i> 1000000 1&#181;s 8 125ns 75,0%
</I>&gt;<i> 800000  1,25&#181;s 10 125ns 80,0%
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This way the bitrates configuration is in the application' point of view
</I>&gt;<i> identical for _all_ controllers e.g. SJA1000, MSCAN, CC770.
</I>
But it may fail for controllers with exotic CAN clock frequencies and
bit-rates like we already know for the MSCAN. Furthermore, if you chose
an hardware independent setting, I definitely prefer our existing
&quot;struct can_bittime_std&quot; (with tq instead of bpr). For example, you
cannot set SAM with your approach.

&gt;<i> To configure a bitrate the following happens.
</I>&gt;<i> echo &quot;800000&quot; &gt; can_bitrate
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> SYSFS drivers passes the parameters to the controller specific function
</I>&gt;<i> (e.g. sja1000_set_bitrate_parameters(struct bitrate_params *params), it
</I>&gt;<i> then calculate the btregs based on the passed parameters and the CAN
</I>&gt;<i> system clock provided by the specific device driver.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If someone needs more exotic bitrates we may provide a can_custom_bitrate
</I>&gt;<i> like:
</I>&gt;<i> echo &quot;800000 1,25&#181;s 10 125ns 80,0%&quot; &gt; can_custom_bitrate.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This is also same handling for an application no matter which controller
</I>&gt;<i> type is used.
</I>
Yes, but the settings may not work, as Uwe pointed out.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> With this solution the normal user and the sophisticated user are satisfied.
</I>
No, see above. The expert might not be happy with the calculated values
and he has no way to set the bit timing regs directly. It could use a
common tool to calculate them or write its own if he knows what he's doing.

&gt;<i> This also solve the kernel maintenance problem, the table is only defined
</I>&gt;<i> once and additional bitrates are supported from the userspace.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> And this works for all controller, since they must support things like
</I>&gt;<i> sample point, quantas (via CAN system clock?), ...
</I>
I'm afraid that we fail to provide a function working well for all
controllers and clocks out there.

More comments are welcome?

Wolfgang.
