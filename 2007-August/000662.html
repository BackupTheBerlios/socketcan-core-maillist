Hi Marc,

the slcan driver is just an adaption of the slip.c driver and hold's all
the insufficiencies that come with the slip.c driver :-/

The slcan driver can only handle the encapsulation and decapsulation of
the 'ASCII-CAN-frames' and is not able to e.g. set the baudrate.
Therefore i always use the slcan driver like this:

1) plug the CAN dongle into USB socket
2) the kernel discovered the USB&lt;-&gt;Serial adapter and the port shows up
   as /dev/ttyUSB0.
3) load slcan.ko

3a) start your favourite serial terminal programm (e.g. minicom) on /dev/ttyUSB0
3b) check the proper communication the serial CAN adaptor
3c) set the baudrate (e.g. with &quot;S6&quot; and start the communication with the &quot;O&quot; open command)

At this point you can see the received CAN data frames in your terminal programm.

4) use slcan_attach (can-utils/slcan_attach.c revision 456):
   ./slcan_attach /dev/ttyUSB0 as root

Now the ASCII stream is redirected to the slcan driver.
The terminal programm just remains open (which is surely the solution of your remarked issue). 

5) ifconfig slc0 shows an interface
6) ifconfig slc0 up works fine :)

After detaching the slc0 with ./slcan_attach -d ... the ASCII stream is enabled on the terminal programm again.

Finally the slcan driver is a working proof of concept based on the slip driver but the settings of baudrates and all these things done by the pppd (e.g. to hold the /dev/ttyUSB0 open) are currently missing.

See some comments in my SVN commit (that should better have gone into some README.slcan :-)

<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/pipermail/socketcan-commit/2007-February/000140.html">https://lists.berlios.de/pipermail/socketcan-commit/2007-February/000140.html</A>


&gt;<i> P.S.: Which USB CAN devices are compatible with this driver?
</I>
See the supported devices in my collected protocol comparison under

<A HREF="http://developer.berlios.de/project/showfiles.php?group_id=6475&amp;release_id=13040">http://developer.berlios.de/project/showfiles.php?group_id=6475&amp;release_id=13040</A>

As you can see here the dark green marked lines are directly handled by
the slcan driver.
This CAN/ASCII protocol is commonly known under &quot;Lawicel Protocol&quot;
(www.can232.com, www.canusb.com) as these guys introduced this kind of
ASCII encapsulation of CAN-data and CAN-controll. The slcan driver
supports only the really common commands for sending and receiving
CAN-frames at CAN-frame ASCII stream level for this CAN adapter class.

&gt;<i> What about
</I>&gt;<i> other non compatibel CAN devices, the slcan driver should be made
</I>&gt;<i> modular in some way.
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>
In what way? As stated above the slcan driver is no magic thing and only
supports the CAN _data_ ASCII encapsulation and not even the settings of
baudrate (which analogue to SLIP should not be made on this layer). I
appreciate the current slcan driver to be that simple as it also covers
a bunch of existing CAN 'serial' adaptors. Btw. i remember there was a
discussion about some kind of binary protocol over a USB/serial adaptor
... so IMHO would see two approaches:

1. Implement a new (non ASCII) protocol into the slcan driver, which may
support some more error handling in the data stream handling than the
current slcan adapters do. But it should not break with the baudrate
setting outside the 'attached' mode.

2. Move the new adaptor to support the Lawicel protocol and extend the
protocol for the missing functionalities that are needed.

Best regards,
Oliver
