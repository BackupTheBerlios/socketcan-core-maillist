I would suggest to create a git on kernel.org which would imply that you ask
for an account on kernel.org.

I've now been working with the netlink configuration interface and it feels
_much_ better than the sysfs interface.

So i wonder if we should tag the current trunk and move the new trunk
completely to netlink without sysfs support ?!?

Do you know how far in kernel history the netlink interface works?

If it's since e.g. 2.6.18, i would suggest to make a cut there and only
support 2.6.18+ and netlink on the SocketCAN SVN trunk.

And if someone needs &lt;2.6.18 he could use the tagged sysfs version.

Any opinions?

Regards,
Oliver
